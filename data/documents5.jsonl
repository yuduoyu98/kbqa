Hunnish set of horse trappings , 4th century ; chamfron , bridle mounts and whip handle , Walters Art Museum <P> The Huns were a nomadic people who lived in Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , and Central Asia between the 4th century AD and the 6th century AD . According to European tradition , they were first reported living east of the Volga River , in an area that was part of Scythia at the time ; the Huns ' arrival is associated with the migration westward of a Scythian people , the Alans . By 370 AD , the Huns had arrived on the Volga , and by 430 the Huns had established a vast , if short - lived , dominion in Europe . </P> <P> In the 18th century , the French scholar Joseph de Guignes became the first to propose a link between the Huns and the Xiongnu people , who were northern neighbours of China in the 3rd century BC . Since Guignes ' time , considerable scholarly effort has been devoted to investigating such a connection . However , there is no scholarly consensus on a direct connection between the dominant element of the Xiongnu and that of the Huns . Priscus , a 5th - century Roman diplomat and Greek historian , mentions that the Huns had a language of their own ; little of it has survived and its relationships have mainly been considered the Turkic or Mongolic languages . Numerous other ethnic groups were included under Attila the Hun 's rule , including very many speakers of Gothic , which some modern scholars describe as a lingua franca of the Empire . Their main military technique was mounted archery . </P> <P> The Huns may have stimulated the Great Migration , a contributing factor in the collapse of the Western Roman Empire . They formed a unified empire under Attila the Hun , who died in 453 ; after a defeat at the Battle of Nedao their empire would quickly disintegrate over the next 15 years . Their descendants , or successors with similar names , are recorded by neighbouring populations to the south , east and west as having occupied parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia approximately from the 4th century to the 6th century . Variants of the Hun name are recorded in the Caucasus until the early 8th century . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Origin </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Before Attila </Li> <Li> 2.2 Under Attila and Bleda </Li> <Li> 2.3 Unified Empire under Attila </Li> <Li> 2.4 After Attila </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Society and culture <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Appearance </Li> <Li> 3.2 Artificial cranial deformation </Li> <Li> 3.3 Government </Li> <Li> 3.4 Language </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Warfare <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Strategy and tactics </Li> <Li> 4.2 Military equipment </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Legacy <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Legends </Li> <Li> 5.2 Claims of Hunnic origins </Li> <Li> 5.3 20th - century use in reference to Germans </Li> <Li> 5.4 Sectarian slur in Northern Ireland and Scotland </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 Notes </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Sources <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Primary sources </Li> <Li> 9.2 Secondary sources </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Origin ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Huns were `` a confederation of warrior bands '' , ready to integrate other groups to increase their military power , in the Eurasian Steppe in the 4th to 6th centuries AD . Most aspects of their ethnogenesis ( including their language and their links to other peoples of the steppes ) are uncertain . Walter Pohl explicitly states : `` All we can say safely is that the name Huns , in late antiquity , described prestigious ruling groups of steppe warriors . '' </P> <P> The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus , who completed his work of the history of the Roman Empire in the early 390s , recorded that the `` people of the Huns ... dwell beyond the Sea of Azov near the frozen ocean '' . Jerome associated them with the Scythians in a letter , written four years after the Huns invaded the empire 's eastern provinces in 395 . The equation of the Huns with the Scythians , together with a general fear of the coming of the Antichrist in the late 4th century , gave rise to their identification with Gog and Magog ( whom Alexander the Great had shut off behind inaccessible mountains , according to a popular legend ) . This demonization of the Huns is also reflected in Jordanes 's Getica , written in the 6th century , which portrayed them as a people descending from `` unclean spirits '' and expelled Gothic witches . </P> Hephthalite horseman on British Museum bowl , 460 -- 479 CE . According to Procopius of Caesarea , they were of the same stock as European Huns `` in fact as well as in name '' , but sedentary and white - skinned . <P> The 6th - century Roman historian Procopius of Caesarea ( Book I. ch. 3 ) , related the Huns of Europe with the Hephthalites or `` White Huns '' who subjugated the Sassanids and invaded northwestern India , stating that they were of the same stock , `` in fact as well as in name '' , although he contrasted the Huns with the Hephthalites , in that the Hephthalites were sedentary , white - skinned , and possessed `` not ugly '' features : </P> <P> The Ephthalitae Huns , who are called White Huns ( ... ) The Ephthalitae are of the stock of the Huns in fact as well as in name , however they do not mingle with any of the Huns known to us , for they occupy a land neither adjoining nor even very near to them ; but their territory lies immediately to the north of Persia ( ... ) They are not nomads like the other Hunnic peoples , but for a long period have been established in a goodly land ... They are the only ones among the Huns who have white bodies and countenances which are not ugly . It is also true that their manner of living is unlike that of their kinsmen , nor do they live a savage life as they do ; but they are ruled by one king , and since they possess a lawful constitution , they observe right and justice in their dealings both with one another and with their neighbours , in no degree less than the Romans and the Persians </P> <P> Since Joseph de Guignes in the 18th century , modern historians have associated the Huns who appeared on the borders of Europe in the 4th century AD with the Xiongnu ( `` howling slaves '' ) who had invaded China from the territory of present - day Mongolia between the 3rd century BC and the 2nd century AD . Due to the devastating defeat by the Chinese Han dynasty , the northern branch of the Xiongnu had retreated north - westward ; their descendants may have migrated through Eurasia and consequently they may have some degree of cultural and genetic continuity with the Huns . Otto J. Maenchen - Helfen was the first to challenge the traditional approach , based primarily on the study of written sources , and to emphasize the importance of archaeological research . Thereafter the identification of the Xiongnu as the Huns ' ancestors became controversial among some . </P> Hun cauldrons <P> The similarity of their ethnonyms is one of the most important links between the two peoples . The Buddhist monk Dharmarakṣa , who was an important translator of Indian religious texts in the 3rd century AD , applied the word Xiongnu when translating the references to the Huna people into Chinese . According to Zhengzhang Shangfang , Xiongnu was pronounced ( hoŋ. naː ) in Late Old Chinese , corresponding well to Huna . A Sogdian merchant described the invasion of northern China by the `` Xwn '' people in a letter , written in 313 AD . Étienne de la Vaissière asserts both documents prove that Huna or Xwn were the `` exact transcriptions '' of the Chinese `` Xiongnu '' name . Christopher P. Atwood rejects that interpretation because of the `` very poor phonological match '' between the three words . For instance , Xiongnu begins with a voiceless velar fricative , Huna with a voiceless glottal fricative ; Xiongnu is a two - syllable word , but Xwn only has one syllable . However , Atwood agrees with the overall idenfitication between the two , showing instead that Xwn comes via Chinese transcription of Wēnnàshāh into Bactrian Onnashāh and from there into Sogdian while Sanskrit Huna came via Chinese Huní and Greek Khōnai . He argues it was ultimately transmitted by Baktrian Greek merchants to the Pontic where it became Ounni and Hunni in Roman Greek and Latin . The Chinese Book of Wei contain references to `` the remains of the descendants of the Xiongnu '' who lived in the region of the Altai Mountains in the early 5th century AD . According to De la Vaissière , the Chinese source proves that nomadic groups preserved their Xiongnu identity for centuries after the fall of their empire . Most ancient texts in Europe and Asia , including Chinese , Indian and Islamic studies state that Huns originally came from north of China . According to Edwin G. Pulleyblank , European Huns comprised two groups of tribes with different ethnic affinities and the ruling group that bore the name Hun was directly connected with the Xiongnu . </P> <P> Both the Xiongnu and Huns used bronze cauldrons , similarly to all peoples of the steppes . Based on the study and categorization of cauldrons from archaeological sites of the Eurasian Steppes , archaeologist Toshio Hayashi concludes that the spread of the cauldrons `` may indicate the route of migration of the Hunnic tribes '' from Mongolia to the northern region of Central Asia in the 2nd or 3rd century AD , and from Central Asia towards Europe in the second half of the 4th century , which also implies the Huns ' association with the Xiongnu . The Huns practised artificial cranial deformation , but there is no evidence of such practice among the Xiongnu . This custom had already been practised in the Eurasian Steppes in the Bronze Age and in the early Iron Age , but it disappeared around 500 BC . It again started to spread among the local inhabitants of the region of the Talas River and in the Pamir Mountains in the 1st century BC . In addition to the Huns , the custom is also evidenced among the Yuezhi and Alans . The lengthy pony - tail , which was a characteristic of the Xiongnu , was not documented among the Huns . </P> <P> When writing of the relationship between the Xiongnu and Huns , historian Hyun Jin Kim concludes : `` Thus to refer to Hun - Xiongnu links in terms of old racial theories or even ethnic affiliations simply makes a mockery of the actual historical reality of these extensive , multiethnic , polyglot steppe empires '' . He also emphasizes that `` the ancestors of the Hunnic core tribes ... were part of the Xiongnu Empire and possessed a strong Xiongnu element , and the ruling elite of the Huns ... claimed to belong to the political tradition of this imperial entity . '' Taking into account the historical gap between the Chinese reports of the Xiongnu and the European records of the Huns , Peter Heather states : `` Even if we do make some connection between fourth - century Huns and first - century ( Xiongnu ) , therefore , an awful lot of water had passed under an awful lot of bridges during 300 years worth of lost history . '' </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Before Attila ( edit ) </H3> A suggested path of Hunnic movement westwards <P> The 2nd - century geographer Ptolemy mentioned a people called Chuni ( Χοῦνοι or Χουνοί ) when listing the peoples of the western region of the Eurasian Steppes . The Chuni lived `` between the Bastarnae and the Roxolani '' , according to Ptolemy . Edward Arthur Thompson said , the similarity between the two ethnonyms ( Chuni and Huns ) is only a coincidence : Western Roman authors often wrote Chunni or Chuni in reference to the Huns ; East Romans never used the guttural `` ( x ) '' at the beginning of their name . Maenchen - Helfen and Denis Sinor also dispute the association of the Chuni with Attila 's Huns . However , Maenchen - Helfen proposes that Ammianus Marcellinus referred to Ptolemy 's report of the Chuni when stating that the Huns `` are mentioned only cursorily in ancient writers '' . He does not exclude either that the Urugundi who invaded the Roman Empire from the steppes to the north of the Lower Danube in 250 AD , according to Zosimus , were identical with the Vurugundi , whom Agathias listed among the Hunnic tribes . </P> <P> The Romans became aware of the Huns when the Hunnic invasion of the Pontic steppes forced thousands of Goths to move to the Lower Danube to seek refuge in the Roman Empire in 376 , according to the contemporaneous Ammianus Marcellinus . Their sudden appearance in the written sources suggests that the Huns crossed the Volga River from the east not much earlier . They invaded the land of the Alans , which was located to the east of the Don River , slaughtering many of them and forcing the survivors to submit themselves to them or to flee across the Don . The reasons for the Huns ' sudden attack on the neighboring peoples are unknown . After rejecting several possible reasons ( including a climate change in the steppes and the neighboring peoples ' pressure ) , Peter Heather concludes that the Hunnic Empire developed from `` warbands on the make '' , launching profitable plundering raids , which enabled them to increase their military power and to impose their authority on the neighboring peoples . </P> <P> After they subjugated the Alans , the Huns and their Alan auxiliaries started plundering the wealthy settlements of the Greuthungi , or eastern Goths , to the west of the Don . The Greuthungic king , Ermanaric , resisted for a while , but finally `` he found release from his fears by taking his own life '' , according to Ammianus Marcellinus . Marcellinus 's report refers either to Ermanaric 's suicide or to his ritual sacrifice . His great - nephew , Vithimiris , succeeded him . He hired Huns to fight against the Alans who invaded the Greuthungi 's land , but he was killed in a battle . </P> <P> After Vithimiris 's death , most Greuthungi submitted themselves to the Huns . Those who decided to resist marched to the Dniester River which was the border between the lands of the Greuthungi and the Thervingi , or western Goths . They were under the command of Alatheus and Saphrax , because Vithimiris 's son , Viderichus , was a child . Athanaric , the leader of the Thervingi , met the refugees along the Dniester at the head of his troops . However , a Hunnic army bypassed the Goths and attacked them from the rear , forcing Athanaric to retreat towards the Carpathian Mountains . Athanaric wanted to fortify the borders , but Hunnic raids into the land west of the Dniester continued . Most Thervingi realized that they could not resist the Huns . They went to the Lower Danube , requesting asylum in the Roman Empire . The Greuthingi under the leadership of Alatheus and Saphrax also marched to the river . Most Roman troops had been transferred from the Balkan Peninsula to fight against the Sassanid Empire in Armenia . Emperor Valens permitted the Thervingi to cross the Lower Danube and to settle in the Roman Empire in the autumn of 376 . The Thervingi were followed by the Greuthingi , and also by the Taifali and `` other tribes that formerly dwelt with the Goths and Taifali '' to the north of the Lower Danube , according to Zosimus . Food shortage and abuse stirred the Goths to revolt in early 377 . The ensuing war between the Goths and the Romans lasted for more than five years . </P> The Barbarian invasions of the 5th century were triggered by the destruction of the Gothic kingdoms by the Huns in 372 -- 375 . The city of Rome was captured and looted by the Visigoths in 410 and by the Vandals in 455 . <P> Support for the Gothic chieftains diminished as refugees headed into Thrace and towards the safety of the Roman garrisons . </P> <P> After these invasions , the Huns begin to be noted as Foederati and mercenaries . As early as 380 , a group of Huns was given Foederati status and allowed to settle in Pannonia . Hunnish mercenaries were also seen on several occasions in the succession struggles of the Eastern and Western Roman Empire during the late 4th century . However , it is most likely that these were individual mercenary bands , not a Hunnish kingdom . </P> <P> In 395 the Huns began their first large - scale attack on the Eastern Roman Empire . Huns attacked in Thrace , overran Armenia , and pillaged Cappadocia . They entered parts of Syria , threatened Antioch , and swarmed through the province of Euphratesia . The forces of Emperor Theodosius were fully committed in the west so the Huns moved unopposed until the end of 398 when the eunuch Eutropius gathered together a force composed of Romans and Goths and succeeded in restoring peace . It is uncertain though , whether or not Eutropius ' forces defeated the Huns or whether the Huns left on their own . There is no record of a notable victory by Eutropius and there is evidence that the Hunnish forces were already leaving the area by the time he gathered his forces . </P> <P> Whether put to flight by Eutropius , or leaving on their own , the Huns had left the Eastern Roman Empire by 398 . After this , the Huns invaded the Sassanid Empire . This invasion was initially successful , coming close to the capital of the empire at Ctesiphon ; however , they were defeated badly during the Persian counterattack and retreated toward the Caucasus Mountains via the Derbend Pass . </P> Detail of Hunnish gold and garnet bracelet , 5th century , Walters Art Museum <P> During their brief diversion from the Eastern Roman Empire , the Huns appear to have threatened tribes further west , as evidenced by Radagaisus ' entering Italy at the end of 405 and the crossing of the Rhine into Gaul by Vandals , Sueves , and Alans in 406 . The Huns do not then appear to have been a single force with a single ruler . Many Huns were employed as mercenaries by both East and West Romans and by the Goths . Uldin , the first Hun known by name , headed a group of Huns and Alans fighting against Radagaisus in defense of Italy . Uldin was also known for defeating Gothic rebels giving trouble to the East Romans around the Danube and beheading the Goth Gainas around 400 -- 401 . Gainas ' head was given to the East Romans for display in Constantinople in an apparent exchange of gifts . </P> <P> The East Romans began to feel the pressure from Uldin 's Huns again in 408 . Uldin crossed the Danube and captured a fortress in Moesia named Castra Martis , which was betrayed from within . Uldin then proceeded to ransack Thrace . The East Romans tried to buy Uldin off , but his sum was too high so they instead bought off Uldin 's subordinates . This resulted in many desertions from Uldin 's group of Huns . </P> <P> Alaric 's brother - in - law , Athaulf , appears to have had Hun mercenaries in his employ south of the Julian Alps in 409 . These were countered by another small band of Huns hired by Honorius ' minister Olympius . Later in 409 , the West Romans stationed ten thousand Huns in Italy and Dalmatia to fend off Alaric , who then abandoned plans to march on Rome . </P> <H3> Under Attila and Bleda ( edit ) </H3> <P> From 434 the brothers Attila and Bleda ruled the Huns together . Attila and Bleda were as ambitious as their uncle Rugila . In 435 they forced the Eastern Roman Empire to sign the Treaty of Margus , giving the Huns trade rights and an annual tribute from the Romans . The Romans also agreed to give up Hunnic refugees ( individuals who could have threatened the brothers ' grip on power ) for execution . With their southern border protected by the terms of this treaty , the Huns could turn their full attention to the further subjugation of tribes to the west . </P> <P> When the Romans breached the treaty in 440 , Attila and Bleda attacked Castra Constantias , a Roman fortress and marketplace on the banks of the Danube . The Eastern Romans stopped delivery of the agreed tribute , and they broke other conditions of the Treaty of Margus . The Hunnic kings turned their attention back to the Eastern Romans . Reports that the Bishop of Margus had crossed into Hun lands and desecrated royal graves further angered the Hun kings . War broke out between the two empires , and the Huns overcame a weak Roman army to raze the cities of Margus , Singidunum and Viminacium . Although a truce was signed in 441 , two years later Constantinople again failed to deliver the tribute and war resumed . In the following campaign , Hun armies came alarmingly close to Constantinople , sacking Sardica , Arcadiopolis and Philippopolis along the way . Suffering a complete defeat at the Battle of Chersonesus , the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II gave in to Hun demands and in autumn 443 signed the Peace of Anatolius with the two Hun kings . The Huns returned to their lands with a vast train full of plunder . </P> <H3> Unified Empire under Attila ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> Hunnic Empire </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 370s -- 469 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> The Hunnic Empire under Attila </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Capital </Td> <Td> Not specified </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Languages </Td> <Td> Hunnic Gothic Various tribal languages </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Government </Td> <Td> Tribal Confederation </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> High King </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 370s </Td> <Td> Balamber </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> c. 435 -- 445 </Td> <Td> Attila and Bleda </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 445 -- 453 </Td> <Td> Attila </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 453 -- 469 </Td> <Td> Dengizich </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> History </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Huns appear north - west of the Caspian Sea </Td> <Td> pre 370s </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Balamber began uniting the Huns and Germanic tribes </Td> <Td> 370s </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Attila and Bleda become co-rulers of the united tribes </Td> <Td> 437 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Death of Bleda , Attila becomes sole ruler </Td> <Td> 445 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Battle of the Catalaunian Plains </Td> <Td> 451 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Invasion of northern Italy </Td> <Td> 452 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Battle of Nedao </Td> <Td> 454 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Dengizich , son of Attila , dies </Td> <Td> 469 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Today part of </Td> <Td> Hungary Ukraine Moldova Russia Romania Slovakia Czech Republic Poland Germany Belarus Serbia Austria Lithuania Croatia Bulgaria </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Bleda died in 445 , with some historians speculating that his death was at the hands of Attila . With his brother gone , Attila was able to establish undisputed control over his subjects . In 447 , Attila turned the Huns back toward the Eastern Roman Empire once more . His invasion of the Balkans and Thrace was devastating . The Eastern Roman Empire was already beset by internal problems , such as famine and plague , as well as riots and a series of earthquakes in Constantinople itself . A last - minute rebuilding of its walls preserved Constantinople unscathed . Victory over a Roman army left the Huns virtually unchallenged in Eastern Roman lands and they raided as far south as Thermopylae . Only disease forced them to retreat , and the war came to an end in 449 with an agreement in which the Romans agreed to pay Attila an annual tribute of 2100 pounds of gold . Our only first - hand account of conditions among the Huns and of Attila himself is by Priscus , an official in the peace embassy to Attila . </P> <P> Throughout their raids on the Eastern Roman Empire , the Huns had maintained good relations with the Western Empire , and in particular with Flavius Aetius , a powerful Roman general ( sometimes even referred to as the de facto ruler of the Western Empire ) who in his youth had spent time as a hostage with the Huns . However , this all changed in 450 when Honoria , sister of the Western Roman Emperor Valentinian III , sent Attila a ring and requested his help to escape her betrothal to a senator . Attila claimed her as his bride and half the Western Roman Empire as dowry . Additionally , a dispute arose between Attila and Aetius about the rightful heir to a king of the Salian Franks . Finally , Attila 's ability to distribute treasure to favoured followers was an important support to his power , and the repeated extortion from the Eastern Roman Empire had left it with little to plunder . </P> <P> In 451 , Attila 's forces entered Gaul , accumulating contingents from the Franks , Goths and Burgundian tribes en route . Once in Gaul , the Huns first attacked Metz , then his armies continued westwards , passing both Paris and Troyes to lay siege to Orléans . </P> <P> Aetius was given the duty of relieving Orléans by Emperor Valentinian III . Bolstered by Frankish and Visigothic troops ( under King Theodoric ) , Aetius ' own Roman army met the Huns at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains . Although a tactical defeat for Attila , thwarting his invasion of Gaul and forcing his retreat back to non-Roman lands , the macrohistorical significance of the allied and Roman victory is a matter of debate . </P> <P> The following year , Attila renewed his claims to Honoria and territory in the Western Roman Empire . Leading his horde across the Alps and into Northern Italy , he sacked and razed the cities of Aquileia , Vicetia , Verona , Brixia , Bergamum and Milan . Hoping to avoid the sack of Rome , Emperor Valentinian III sent three envoys , the high civilian officers Gennadius Avienus and Trigetius , as well as Pope Leo I , who met Attila at Mincio in the vicinity of Mantua , and obtained from him the promise that he would withdraw from Italy and negotiate peace with the emperor . Prosper of Aquitaine describes the historic meeting , giving all the credit of the successful negotiation to Leo . Priscus reports that superstitious fear of the fate of Alaric -- who died shortly after sacking Rome in 410 -- gave him pause . More practically , Italy had suffered from a terrible famine in 451 and her crops were faring little better in 452 ; Attila 's invasion of the plains of Northern Italy this year did not improve the harvest . To advance on Rome would have required supplies which were not available in Italy , and taking the city would not have improved Attila 's supply situation . Secondly , an East Roman force had crossed the Danube and defeated the Huns who had been left behind by Attila to safeguard their home territories . Attila , hence , faced heavy human and natural pressures to retire from Italy before moving south of the Po . Attila retreated without Honoria or her dowry . </P> <P> The new Eastern Roman Emperor Marcian then halted tribute payments . From the Pannonian Basin , Attila planned to attack Constantinople . However , in 453 he married a girl with the Germanic name Ildico , and died of a haemorrhage on his wedding night . </P> <H3> After Attila ( edit ) </H3> <P> After Attila 's death in 453 , the Hunnic Empire faced an internal power struggle between its vassalized Germanic peoples and the Hunnic ruling body . Led by Ellak , Attila 's favored son and ruler of the Akatziri , the Huns engaged the Gepid king Ardaric at the Battle of Nedao , who led a coalition of Germanic Peoples to overthrow Hunnic imperial authority . The Amali Goths would revolt the same year under Valamir , allegedly defeating the Huns in a separate engagement . However , this did not result in the complete collapse of Hunnic power in the Carpathian region , but did result in the loss of many of their Germanic vassals . At the same time , the Huns were also dealing with the arrival of more Oghur Turkic speaking peoples from the East , including the Oghurs , Saragurs , Onogurs , and the Sabirs . In 463 , the Saragurs defeated the Akatziri , or Akatir Huns , and asserted dominance in the Pontic region . </P> <P> In 458 some Huns served under Tudila in Majorian 's army , probably belonging to a group settled under Emnetzur and Ultzindur in Dacia Ripensis . The western Huns under Dengzich were experiencing difficulties in 461 , when they were defeated by Valamir in a war against the Sadages , a people allied with the Huns . His campaigning was also met with dissatisfaction from Ernak , ruler of the Akatziri Huns , who wanted to focus on the incoming Oghur speaking peoples . In 465 -- 466 , Ernak and Dengzich sent ambassadors to Constantinople requesting a peace treaty , and asking to establish a market for the exchange of needed provisions . However these requests were rejected , and Dengzich attacked the Romans in 467 , without the assistance of Ernak . He was surrounded by the Romans and besieged , and came to an agreement that they would surrender if they were given land and his starving forces given food . During the negotiations , a Hun in service of the Romans named Chelchel persuaded the enemy Goths to attack their Hun overlords . The Romans , under their General Aspar and with the help of his bucellarii , then attacked the quarreling Goths and Huns , defeating them . </P> <P> In 469 , Anagastes , the son of Arnegisclus who was slain by Attila , brought Dengzich 's head and paraded it through the streets before mounting it on a stake in the Hippodrome . Some Historians , like John Man , accept this date as the end of the Hunnic Empire . However others , such as Kim , argue it continued under Ernak who absorbed the incoming Oghur speakers . These people were similar to the Huns and Attila 's empire continued as the Kutrigur and Utigur Hunno - Bulgars . This conclusion is still subject to some controversy . </P> <H2> Society and Culture ( edit ) </H2> A 14th - century chivalric - romanticized painting of the Huns laying siege to a city . Note anachronistic details in weapons , armor and city - type . Hungarian Chronicon Pictum , 1360 . Roman villa in Gaul sacked by the hordes of Attila the Hun . Illustration from a book by Georges Rochegrosse . <H3> Appearance ( edit ) </H3> <P> As the Huns were illiterate and thus kept no records , all surviving accounts were written by enemies of the Huns , and none describe the Huns as attractive either morally or in appearance . Jordanes , a Goth writing in Italy in 551 , a century after the collapse of the Hunnic Empire , describes the Huns as a `` savage race , which dwelt at first in the swamps , a stunted , foul and puny tribe , scarcely human and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech . '' Jordanes goes on to write : </P> <P> They made their foes flee in horror because their swarthy aspect was fearful , and they had , if I may call it so , a sort of shapeless lump , not a head , with pin - holes rather than eyes . Their hardihood is evident in their wild appearance , and they are beings who are cruel to their children on the very day they are born . For they cut the cheeks of the males with a sword , so that before they receive the nourishment of milk they must learn to endure wounds . Hence they grow old beardless and their young men are without comeliness , because a face furrowed by the sword spoils by its scars the natural beauty of a beard . They are short in stature , quick in bodily movement , alert horsemen , broad shouldered , ready in the use of bow and arrow , and have firm - set necks which are ever erect in pride . Though they live in the form of men , they have the cruelty of wild beasts . </P> <P> Jordanes also recounted how Priscus had described Attila the Hun , the Emperor of the Huns from 434 -- 453 , as : `` Short of stature , with a broad chest and a large head ; his eyes were small , his beard thin and sprinkled with grey ; and he had a flat nose and tanned skin , showing evidence of his origin . '' </P> <P> In forming their view of Attila 's people , the Romans tapped into attitudes inherited from the Greeks . These were the vilest creatures imaginable . They came from the North and everyone knew that the colder the climate was , the more barbaric the people were . They knew nothing of metal , had no religion and lived like savages , without fire , eating their food raw , living off roots , and meat tenderized by placing it under their horses ' saddles . They had no buildings , of course , not so much as a reed hut , indeed , they feared the very idea of venturing under a roof . </P> <P> The description of Huns given by the Romans has prompted some historians to believe they were of East Asian origin . Denis Sinor , noting the paucity of anthropological evidence , wrote that `` there is no reason to question the basic accuracy of the western descriptions , and the absence of massive supporting evidence by physical anthropology can not weaken the point they so tellingly make . It is the unusual that most attracts attention . '' However , Austrian traveler Maenchen - Helfen wrote in the 20th century : </P> <P> Ammianus ' description begins with a strange misunderstanding ... This was repeated by Claudian and Sidonius and reinterpreted by Cassiodorus . Ammianus ' explanation of the thin beards is wrong . Like so many other people , the Huns inflicted wounds on their live flesh as a sign of grief when their kinsmen were dying . </P> <H3> Artificial cranial deformation ( edit ) </H3> Artificial cranial deformation of the Alchon Huns , possible relatives of the European Huns , as seen on a portrait of king Khingila c. 430 -- 490 CE . <P> Artificial cranial deformation was practiced by the Huns and sometimes by tribes under their influence . Artificial cranial deformation of the circular type can be used to trace the route that the Huns took from north China to the Central Asian steppes and subsequently to the southern Russian steppes . The people who practiced annular type artificial cranial deformation in Central Asia were Yuezhi / Kushans . </P> <P> Some artificially deformed crania from the 5th -- 6th Century AD have been found in Northeastern Hungary and elsewhere in Western Europe . None of them have any Mongoloid features and all the skulls appear Europoid ; these skulls may have belonged to Germanic or other subject groups whose parents wished to elevate their status by following a custom introduced by the Huns . </P> <H3> Government ( edit ) </H3> <P> Hunnic governmental structure has long been debated . In the past many scholars argued that the Huns did not have a central organization until after they entered Europe . Peter Heather argued the Huns were a disorganized confederation in which leaders acted completely independently and that eventually established a ranking heirarchy , much like Germanic societies . However this has been challenged in recent years . According to Kim , it is now believed that the Huns continued the Xiongnu organization , in which their polity was divided into Left , Right , South , and North , in that order of priority . It is also thought that the Huns continued the council of `` six horns / nobles '' that the Xiongnu had under their emperor . It is unknown what the Hun emperor was called , but the terms Chanyu , Aniliki , Shah , and Yabgu are possible or interchangeable titles for the same position , as they were in use by other contemporary peoples during that period . Likewise , it is suggested that that the Huns continued to use the decimal military organization of the Xiongnu as well . </P> <H3> Language ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Hunnic language <P> A variety of languages were spoken within the Hun Empire . It has been supposed that by the 440s , the `` Huns '' were more Germanic - speaking subject than speakers of Hunnic , and as such Gothic may have been a lingua franca of the Empire . Kim however points out that there is no evidence for the idea that Gothic was a lingua franca . Subjects of the Huns also included Iranian - speaking Alans and Sarmatians . Based on some etymological interpretation of the words strava , medos , and kamos and subsequent historical appearance , the other languages have been taken to include a form of Proto - Slavic language . </P> <P> Priscus noted that the Hunnic language differed from other languages spoken at Attila 's court . He recounts how Zerco made Attila 's guests laugh also by the `` promiscuous jumble of words , Latin mixed with Hunnish and Gothic '' . Priscus said that Attila 's `` Scythian '' subjects spoke `` besides their own barbarian tongues , either Hunnish , or Gothic , or , as many have dealings with the Western Romans , Latin ; but not one of them easily speaks Greek , except captives from the Thracian or Illyrian frontier regions '' . </P> <P> The ancient sources are thus clear that there was a Hunnic language . The literary sources preserve many names , and three Indo - European words ( medos , kamos , strava ) , which have been studied for more than a century and a half . Otto Maenchen - Helfen noted that the thesis suggesting the Huns spoke a Turkic language has a long history behind it . Maenchen - Helfen held that by Turkic origin of Hunnic tribal and proper names , the Huns spoke a Turkic language . Denis Sinor argued that `` at least part of the Hun leadership was Turkic - speaking '' . </P> <P> Traditionally notable studies of proper names chronologically include that of Gyula Németh , Gerhard Doerfer , Maenchen - Helfen , and Omeljan Pritsak . In Pritsak 's 1982 study The Hunnic Language of the Attila Clan , he analyzes the 33 survived personal names and concludes : </P> <P> It was not a Turkic language , but one between Turkic and Mongolian , probably closer to the former than the latter . The language had strong ties to Bulgar language and to modern Chuvash , but also had some important connections , especially lexical and morphological , to Ottoman Turkish and Yakut . </P> <P> On the basis of the existing name records , a number of scholars suggest that the Huns spoke a Turkic language of the Oghur branch , which also includes the Bulgar , Khazar and Chuvash languages . Peter Heather called the Huns `` the first group of Turkic , as opposed to Iranian , nomads to have intruded into Europe '' . Many recent scholars agree that Hunnic was related to Turkic and Mongolian languages . </P> <P> In 2013 , Hyun Jin Kim suggested that `` from the names that we do know , most of which seem to be Turkic ... the Hunnic elite was predominantly Turkic - speaking . '' He also suggests that the Xiongnu , who had originally spoken Yeniseian , flipped to Oghur Turkic when they absorbed the Dingling and crossed into Central Asia , like the later Golden Horde and Chagatai Khanate . He noted that , beside Hunnic , people in Attila 's court also spoke Gothic and Latin , and that in the western part of the Empire , where subjected Goths lived , people described as Huns probably spoke both the Hunnic and Gothic languages . An example would be the Germanic or Germanized names of noted Huns like Laudaricus . </P> <P> Nevertheless , some scholars still conclude that the Hunnic language can not presently be classified , and attempts to classify it as Turkic or Mongolic are speculative . </P> <H2> Warfare ( edit ) </H2> Huns in battle with the Alans . An 1870s engraving after a drawing by Johann Nepomuk Geiger ( 1805 -- 1880 ) . <H3> Strategy and tactics ( edit ) </H3> <P> Hun warfare as a whole is not well studied , and many scholars as of recent have discounted Ammianus ' description of the Huns . This was first pointed out by E.A. Thompson , who stated that the Huns could never have conquered Europe without iron armor and weapons . The only accurate information on Hun warfare comes from the 6th - century Strategikon , which describes the warfare of `` Dealing with the Scythians , that is , Avars , Turks , and others whose way of life resembles that of the Hunnish peoples . '' The Strategikon describes the Avars and Huns as devious and very experienced in military matters . They are described as preferring to defeat their enemies by deceit , surprise attacks , and cutting off supplies . The Huns brought large numbers of horses to use as replacements and to give the impression of a larger army on campaign . The Hunnish peoples did not set up an entrenched camp , but spread out across the grazing fields according to clan , and guard their necessary horses until they began forming the battle line under the cover of early morning . The Strategikon states the Huns also stationed sentries at significant distances and in constant contact with each other in order to prevent surprise attacks . </P> <P> According to the Strategikon , the Huns did not form a battle line in the method that the Romans and Persians used , but in irregularly sized divisions in a single line , and keep a separate force in reserve for ambushes and as a reserve . The Strategikon also states the Huns used deep formations with a dense and even front . Otto Maenchen - Helfen states that the Huns likely formed up in divisions according to tribal clans and families which Ammianus calls Cunei , the leader of which was called a Cur and inherited the title as it was passed down through the clan . The Strategikon states that the Huns kept their spare horses and baggage train to either side of the line about a mile away , with a moderate sized guard , and would sometimes tie their spare horses together behind the main battle line . The Huns preferred to fight at long range , utilizing ambush , encirclement , and the feigned retreat . The Strategikon also makes note of the wedge shaped formations mentioned by Ammianus , and corroborated as familial regiments by Maenchen - Helfen . The Strategikon states the Huns preferred to pursue their enemies relentlessly after a victory and then wear them out by a long siege after defeat . </P> <H3> Military equipment ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Strategikon states the Huns typically used maille , swords , bows , and lances , and that most Hunnic warriors were armed with both the bow and lance and used them interchangeably as needed . It also states the Huns used quilted linen , wool , or sometimes iron barding for their horses and also wore quilted coifs and kaftans . This assessment is largely corroborated by archaeological finds of Hun military equipment , such as the Volnikovka and Brut Burials . </P> <P> A late Roman ridge helmet of the Berkasovo - Type was found with a Hun burial at Concesti . A Hunnic helmet of the Segmentehelm type was found at Chudjasky , and another of the Bandhelm type at Turaevo . Fragments of lamellar helmets dating to the Hunnic period and within the Hunnic sphere have been found at Iatrus , Illichevka , and Kalkhni . Hun lamellar armour has not been found in Europe , although two fragments of likely Hun origin have been found on the Upper Ob and in West Kazakhstan dating to the 3rd -- 4th centuries . An unpublished find at a military warehouse near Toprachioi , Romania is known but it is uncertain if it can be attributed to Hun origin . It is known that the Eurasian Avars introduced Lamellar armor to the Roman Army and Migration Era Germanics in the Middle 6th Century , but this later type does not appear before then . </P> <P> It is also widely accepted that the Huns introduced the langseax , a 60 cm cutting blade that became popular among the migration era Germanics and in the Late Roman Army , into Europe . It is believed these blades originated in China and that the Sarmatians and Huns served as a transmission vector , using shorter seaxes in Central Asia that developed into the narrow langseax in Eastern Europe during the late 4th and first half of the 5th century . These earlier blades date as far back as the 1st century AD , with the first of the newer type appearing in Eastern Europe being the Wien - Simmerming example , dated to the late 4th century AD . Other notable Hun examples include the Langseax from the more recent find at Volnikovka in Russia . </P> <P> The Huns used a type of spatha in the Iranic or Sassanid style , with a long , straight approximately 83cm blade , usually with a diamond shaped iron guard plate . Swords of this style have been found at sites such as Altlussheim , Szirmabesenyo , Volnikovka , Novo - Ivanovka , and Tsibilium 61 . They typically had gold foil hilts , gold sheet scabbards , and scabbard fittings decorated in the polychrome style . The sword was carried in the `` Iranian style '' attached to a swordbelt , rather than on a baldric . </P> <P> The most famous weapon of the Huns , of course , is the Qum Darya - type composite recurve bow , often called the `` Hunnish Bow . '' This bow was invented some time in the 3rd or 2nd centuries BC with the earliest finds near Lake Baikal , but spread across Eurasia long before the Hunnic migration . These bows were typified by being asymmetric in cross-section between 145 - 155cm in length , having between 4 -- 9 lathes on the grip and in the siyahs . Although whole bows rarely survive in European climatic conditions , finds of bone Siyahs are quite common and characteristic of steppe burials . Complete specimens have been found at sites in the Tarim Basin and Gobi Desert such as Niya , Qum Darya , and Shombuuziin - Belchir . Eurasian nomads such as the Huns typically used trilobate diamond shaped iron arrowheads , attached using birch tar and a tang , with typically 75cm shafts and fletching attached with tar and sinew whipping . Such trilobate arrowheads are believed to be more accurate and have better penetrating power or capacity to injure than flat arrowheads . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Legends ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

These stories all portray Migration Period events from a millennium earlier . </P> <P> In the Hervarar saga , the Goths make first contact with the bow - wielding Huns and meet them in an epic battle on the plains of the Danube . </P> <P> In the Nibelungenlied , Kriemhild marries Attila ( Etzel in German ) after her first husband Siegfried was murdered by Hagen with the complicity of her brother , King Gunther . She then uses her power as Etzel 's wife to take a bloody revenge in which not only Hagen and Gunther but all Burgundian knights find their death at festivities to which she and Etzel had invited them . </P> <P> In the Völsunga saga , Attila ( Atli in Norse ) defeats the Frankish king Sigebert I ( Sigurðr or Siegfried ) and the Burgundian King Guntram ( Gunnar or Gunther ) , but is later assassinated by Queen Fredegund ( Gudrun or Kriemhild ) , the sister of the latter and wife of the former . </P> <P> In the German `` Saga of Tidreck of Bern '' , its written versions beginning from the 13th century , the Huns are called Frisians . Frisia was often called Hunaland in the Middle Ages . </P> <P> Widsith , possibly one of the oldest pieces of English literature to survive to the present day , lists a number of ancient kings of tribes sorted according to their popularity and impact ; Attila , King of the Huns , comes first , followed immediately by Eormanric of the Ostrogoths . Widsith may be by far the oldest extant work that tells of the Battle of the Goths and Huns , also recounted in later Scandinavian works such as the Hervarar saga ; in Widsith , however , the battle 's details are presented as `` sober historical facts '' rather than as the `` heroic stories '' of later works . The name Attila , rendered in Old English as Ætla , was a given name in use in Anglo - Saxon England ( ex . Bishop Ætla of Dorchester ) and its use in England at the time may have been connected to the heroic kings legend represented in works like Widsith , though historian Otto J. Maenchen - Helfen doubts the use of the name by the Anglo - Saxons had anything to do with the Huns , and argues it was more likely to be based directly on the name 's Germanic origin meaning `` little father '' . </P> <H3> Claims of Hunnic Origins ( edit ) </H3> Atilla -- Kurultáj Székely flag -- Kurultáj , 2014 <P> The Hungarians ( Magyars ) in particular lay claim to Hunnic heritage . Although Magyar tribes only began to settle in the geographical area of present - day Hungary in the very end of the 9th century , some 426 years after the breakup of Attila 's Hunnic Empire , Hungarian prehistory includes Magyar origin myths . There is also a medieval legend of a lineage that makes Attila the sixth - generation ancestor of Árpád conqueror of the modern Pannonian basin , through Attila 's son Csaba , his son Ed , his son Ügyek , his son Előd , his son Álmos . Álmos was ruler of the Magyars and the father of Arpad The national anthem of Hungary describes the Hungarians as `` blood of Bendegúz ' '' ( the medieval and modern Hungarian version of Mundzuk , Attila 's father ) . Attila 's brother , Bleda , is called Buda in modern Hungarian and some medieval chronicles and literary works attribute the name of the city of Buda to him . </P> <P> There is a legend among the Székely people that claims that after the death of Attila , in a battle called the Battle of Krimhilda , 3000 Hun warriors managed to escape and settle in a place called `` Csigle - mező '' ( today Transylvania ) and they changed their name from Huns to Szekler ( Székely ) . According to the Hungarian scholar Egyed , the Székelys speak the Hungarian language `` without any trace of a Turkic substratum '' , indicating that they did not have a language shift during their history , and proposes that the Székelys were descended from privileged Hungarian groups . They therefore could not have been related to the Huns , who most likely spoke an Oghur Turkic dialect . </P> <P> The Anglo - Saxons may have believed themselves to be partly descended from Huns , through their Angle , Saxon , and Jute ancestors . In his Ecclesiastical History of the English People , the historian Bede stated : </P> <P> ... ( M ) any of which nations ( Egbert ) knew there were in Germany , from whom the Angles or Saxons , who now inhabit Britain , are known to have derived their origin ; for which reason they are still corruptly called Garmans by the neighboring nation of the Britons . Such are the Frisons , the Rugins , the Danes , the Huns , the Ancient Saxons , and the Boructuars ( or Bructers ) . There are also in the same parts many other nations still following pagan rites , to whom the aforesaid soldier of Christ designed to repair , ... </P> <P> As James Campbell has noted , this list of peoples has generally been regarded by historians as being a list of peoples living in Germany at the time Bede wrote this passage in the 8th century , `` ( b ) ut the sense of the Latin is that these are the peoples from whom the Anglo - Saxons living in Britain were derived . '' He wrote that the list of peoples fits the 5th century better , when the Anglo - Saxons began migrating to Britain , than the 8th century , and noted that `` Huns sound odd ; it is equally odd that Priscus heard of a boast by Attila that he had authority over the islands in the ocean . '' </P> <H3> 20th - century use in reference to Germans ( edit ) </H3> A First World War Canadian electoral campaign poster <P> On 27 July 1900 , during the Boxer Rebellion in China , Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany gave the order to act ruthlessly towards the rebels : `` Mercy will not be shown , prisoners will not be taken . Just as a thousand years ago , the Huns under Attila won a reputation of might that lives on in legends , so may the name of Germany in China , such that no Chinese will even again dare so much as to look askance at a German . '' </P> <P> The term `` Hun '' from this speech was later used for the Germans by British propaganda during World War I . The comparison was helped by the spiked Pickelhaube helmet worn by German forces until 1916 , which would be reminiscent of images depicting ancient Hun helmets . This usage , emphasising the idea that the Germans were barbarians , was reinforced by Allied propaganda throughout the war . The French songwriter Theodore Botrel described the Kaiser as `` an Attila , without remorse '' , launching `` cannibal hordes '' . </P> <P> The usage of the term `` Hun '' to describe Germans resurfaced during World War II . For example , Winston Churchill 1941 said in a broadcast speech : `` There are less than 70,000,000 malignant Huns , some of whom are curable and others killable , most of whom are already engaged in holding down Austrians , Czechs , Poles and the many other ancient races they now bully and pillage . '' Later that year Churchill referred to the invasion of the Soviet Union as `` the dull , drilled , docile brutish masses of the Hun soldiery , plodding on like a swarm of crawling locusts . '' During this time American President Franklin D. Roosevelt also referred to the German people in this way , saying that an Allied invasion into Southern France would surely `` be successful and of great assistance to Eisenhower in driving the Huns from France . '' </P> <H3> Sectarian slur in northern Ireland and Scotland ( edit ) </H3> <P> `` Hun '' is also used as an sectarian slur against Protestants in Scotland and Northern Ireland . In Scotland , the term has been used by fans of Celtic FC in Old Firm derbies against Rangers FC supporters , while Orange Halls in Ulster have been daubed with graffiti reading KAH ( `` Kill all Huns '' ) . </P> <P> A pamphlet issued to PSNI officers in 2008 listed `` Huns '' -- along with the terms `` black '' , `` prods '' or `` jaffas '' ( referring to the Orange Order ) for Protestants and `` fenians '' , `` taigs '' , `` chucks '' or `` spongers '' for Irish Catholics -- as terms not to use to avoid causing offence . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of Hunnic rulers </Li> <Li> Nomadic empire </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ The Æ / æ in Ætla is pronounced like the ' a ' in ' cat ' in most Modern English dialects ; it is the near - open front unrounded vowel .

A continuation of Stephen King 's novel series of the same name , the film stars Idris Elba as Roland Deschain , a gunslinger on a quest to protect the Dark Tower -- a mythical structure which supports all realities -- while Matthew McConaughey plays his nemesis , Walter Padick , the Man in Black , and Tom Taylor stars as Jake Chambers , a New York boy who becomes Roland 's apprentice . </P> <P> Intended to launch a film and television franchise , the first installment combines elements from several novels in the eight - volume series , and takes place in both modern - day New York City and in Mid-World , Roland 's Old West - style parallel universe . The film also serves as a canonical sequel to the novel series , which concludes with the revelation that Roland 's quest is a cyclical time loop ; the presence of the Horn of Eld , which Roland carries in the film , indicates that this is the next cycle . </P> <P> The Dark Tower premiered at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City on July 31 , 2017 , and was theatrically released in the United States on August 4 , 2017 by Columbia Pictures . It has grossed $109 million worldwide against production budget of $60 million , and received generally negative reviews , with critics calling it `` a dull disappointment without any set audience : incomprehensible to newbies , and wildly unfaithful and simplistic to fans of King 's books '' , though Elba 's performance earned some praise . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Development history <Ul> <Li> 3.1 J.J.

Jake 's mother , stepfather , and psychiatrists dismiss these as dreams resulting from the trauma of his father 's death the previous year . </P> <P> At his apartment home in New York City , a group of workers from an alleged psychiatric facility offer to rehabilitate Jake ; recognizing them from his visions as monsters wearing human skin , he flees . Jake tracks down an abandoned house from one of his visions , discovers a high - tech portal , and travels to a post-apocalyptic world called Mid-World . </P> <P> In Mid-World , Jake encounters the last Gunslinger , Roland Deschain who emerged in his visions . Roland is pursuing Walter Padick , the Man in Black who had also appeared in his dreams across a desert , seeking to kill him in revenge for the murder of his father , Steven . He explains that Walter has been abducting psychic children , and is attempting to use their powers to destroy the Dark Tower , a fabled structure located at the center of the universe ; this will allow monsters from the darkness outside to invade and destroy reality . </P> <P> Roland takes Jake to a village to have his visions interpreted by a seer . Learning of Jake 's escape and journey to Mid-World , Walter investigates , and realizes that Jake has enough psychic potential to destroy the Tower single - handedly . He kills Jake 's stepfather , then interrogates his mother about his visions and kills her . In Mid-World , the seer explains that Roland can find Walter 's base of operations in New York . </P> <P> Walter 's minions , the Taheen , attack the village , but Roland kills them . Roland and Jake return to Earth . When Jake returns home to check in on his parents , he finds their remains and breaks down . Roland vows to avenge them and comforts Jake by teaching him the Gunslinger 's creed and the basics of gun fighting . </P> <P> While Roland re-arms himself at a gun store , Walter captures Jake . At his base , he straps Jake to a machine , intending for him to destroy the Tower . Jake uses his psychic powers to alert Roland to his location , and Roland battles his way through Walter 's henchmen . </P> <P> Walter confronts Roland , wounding him . After Jake reminds him of the Gunslinger 's creed , Roland recovers and kills Walter with a trick shot after a brief fight . Roland destroys the machine , saving the Tower , Jake and the other children . Afterwards , Roland says that he must return to his own world . He offers Jake a place by his side as his companion , which Jake accepts . The two depart for Mid-World . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Idris Elba as Roland Deschain </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> The last of the Gunslingers . On the choice of Elba , director and co-writer Nikolaj Arcel stated , `` For me , it just clicked . He 's such a formidable man . '' He added that he had been an admirer of Elba 's since The Wire , and stated , `` I had to go to Idris and tell him my vision for the entire journey with Roland and the ka - tet . We discussed , who is this character ? What 's he about ? What 's his quest ? What 's his psychology ? We tried to figure out if we saw the same guy . And we absolutely had all the same ideas and thoughts . He had a unique vision for who Roland would be . '' Stephen King himself spoke highly of Elba , stating : `` I love it . I think he 's a terrific actor , one of the best working in the business now . '' On the character of Roland , King noted : `` For me the character is still the character . It 's almost a Sergio Leone character , like the Man with No Name , '' while remarking , `` He can be white or black , it makes no difference to me . I think it opens all kind of exciting possibilities for the backstory . '' </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Matthew McConaughey as Walter Padick , the Man in Black </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> A ruthless ageless deceiver and sorcerer who seeks to reach the tower and rule over its seemingly infinite kingdoms . On the choice of McConaughey , Arcel stated , `` Matthew is an incredible actor who can do anything . That 's how I feel about ( Walter ) . He could do anything . '' About the character of Padick , Arcel added , `` He is this timeless sorcerer , and being a Stephen King fan , I 've read and experienced Walter in various iterations , '' making reference to The Stand and The Eyes of the Dragon . `` He has a very interesting way of seeing the world . He sees it with a sort of delight , even though he is obviously on the wrong side of the light - and - dark spectrum . He 's someone I 've been having a lot of fun with . '' King made mention of him never having a clear image of the character 's face , to which he explained : `` I never really thought of him . But ( in the movie ) he becomes a character who is n't just a mirage that Roland is chasing . The way things are set up , he 's right there .

The project was shelved , before the rights were transitioned to a different production company . Development experienced starts and stops with various filmmakers and studios at different times , including Universal Films , Paramount , Columbia - Tristar Entertainment , and Lionsgate Entertainment . The adaptation went through three major phases of planning : with J.J. Abrams from 2007 to 2009 , Ron Howard from 2010 to 2015 , and finally , the current iteration , announced in March 2015 , produced by Sony Pictures Entertainment and Media Rights Capital , with Nikolaj Arcel directing and Howard remaining in a producing role . </P> <H3> J.J. Abrams ( 2007 -- 2009 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> By early February 2007 , a film adaptation of The Dark Tower series was in the works . J.J. Abrams , co-creator of the television series Lost , was said to be attached to produce and direct . Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof , who co-created Lost with Abrams , optioned The Dark Tower from King for a reported amount of $19 , a number that mysteriously recurs throughout the series . According to issue # 923 of Entertainment Weekly , King `` is an ardent supporter of ( Lost ) and trusts Abrams to translate his vision '' into a film franchise , with Lindelof being `` the leading candidate to write the screenplay for the first installment . '' It was around this time that Marvel Comics launched their graphic novel adaptation of The Dark Tower with The Dark Tower : The Gunslinger Born . Later , in March 2007 , Abrams noted in an interview with Wired that the project is `` something that we are just now talking about with Stephen , so it 's too early for me to say that we 're even officially doing it yet just because the thing is in the early stages of discussion . '' </P> <P> A year later , in February 2008 , Abrams reiterated that The Dark Tower adaptation was in the early stages of development , when interviewed by Reelz Channel . When interviewed by AMC in September 2008 , Abrams admitted that the project needs time he does not have because of Lost , especially since he would like to see a seven - film series ( the eighth novel was published in 2012 ) . However , in May 2009 , Abrams stated to IGN that he and Lindelof were planning on beginning work on The Dark Tower as soon as Lost finished its run . Speaking to MTV News around the same time , Lindelof revealed some apprehension regarding the project , noting that his `` reverence for Stephen King is now getting in the way of what any good writer would do first when they 're adapting a book , which is take creative license . '' In a July 2009 interview with C21 Media , Lindelof revealed that he and Cuse had indeed optioned the rights for The Dark Tower , but said he was wary about committing to such an ambitious project : `` The idea of taking on something that massive again after having done six seasons of Lost is intimidating and slightly frightening , to say the least . '' </P> <P> With these reservations being voiced by the producers , this initial phase of the project came to an end at the end of 2009 after three years , since this was a three - year option . In an interview with USA Today in October 2009 , Damon Lindelof stated : `` You 'll be hard - pressed to find a huger fan of The Dark Tower than me , but that 's probably the reason that I should n't be the one to adapt it . After working six years on Lost , the last thing I want to do is spend the next seven years adapting one of my favorite books of all time . I 'm such a massive Stephen King fan that I 'm terrified of screwing it up . I 'd do anything to see those movies written by someone else . My guess is they will get made because they 're so incredible . But not by me . '' Finally , in November 2009 , Abrams stated that he would not be adapting the series . During an interview with MTV News , Abrams made the following comments : `` The Dark Tower thing is tricky . The truth is that Damon and I are not looking at that right now . '' </P> <H3> Ron Howard ( 2010 -- 2015 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> In April 2010 , five months after Abrams revealed he would no longer pursue his adaptation of The Dark Tower , Universal Pictures was set to produce trilogy of feature films , alternating with two seasons of a television series to bridge gaps between the films . The involved parties included Akiva Goldsman writing the script , Ron Howard directing , and also producing with Brian Grazer and Stephen King . The report was made official by NBC Universal five months later via a press release dated September 8 , 2010 . In an interview with Entertainment Weekly following the announcement , King stated that `` I always thought it would take more than a single movie , but I did n't see this solution coming -- i.e. , several movies and TV series . It was Ron ( Howard ) and Akiva ( Goldsman ) 's idea . Once it was raised , I thought at once it was the solution . '' A month later , the first Dark Tower film was scheduled to open on May 17 , 2013 . In December 2010 , Howard offered the following in regards to the project 's progress : `` It is going well , and it has been incredibly stimulating to work on . I really ca n't stop thinking about it . We 've been meeting and talking and I 've been reading and researching and just kind of living with it . I hope it goes great . I hope it goes the way we think it will . It never does , really . But sometimes it goes better . '' Despite Howard 's enthusiasm , Universal had not yet greenlit the project at that point . </P> <P> By the end of 2010 and the beginning of 2011 , New York Post was reporting that Javier Bardem and Viggo Mortensen were in line to play the lead character of Roland Deschain , and Naomie Harris was being considered for the character of Susannah Dean . Speaking on The Howard Stern Show in January 2011 and qualifying his words with the phrase `` I do n't know if it 's going to happen or not '' , Howard said that after the first film , which would be more action - oriented , a six - episode television miniseries would follow , focusing more on character - driven drama . For his part , Brian Grazer stated around the same time that a casting announcement could be made `` within a week . '' </P> <P> By April 2011 , Mark Verheiden was joining the television portion of the project as executive producer and Akiva Goldsman 's co-writer . The same month , Javier Bardem was cast in the role of Roland . However , just a month later , a report in Variety revealed that Universal may seek another studio 's help , as the project 's budget appeared to be more than they were willing to handle . The Hollywood Reporter wrote later that the project was on the verge of turnaround , and Warner Bros. or Columbia Pictures could potentially take the project on , revealing that Universal had paid $5 million for the rights . Shortly after that , Universal committed to a lower budget for the project and Goldsman began rewriting the script to reflect these changes . </P> <P> Originally , production was slated to begin in September 2011 , but in May 2011 it was being pushed back to February 2012 or early spring . The project was still not greenlit by the studio , which had to happen by July 2011 . Then on July 18 , 2011 , Universal decided to cancel development of the entire project due to budgetary concerns . Despite this , Stephen King was confident Howard would see the project through , stating that he was `` sorry Universal passed , but not really surprised . I bear them no ill will , and trust Ron Howard to get Roland and his friends before the camera somewhere else . He 's very committed to the project . '' In August 2011 , Howard stated that they were `` trying to get outside financing to make it , and distribute it through a major ( studio ) '' , including the fact that Netflix might be an outlet . Later , in October 2011 , Howard confirmed the adaptation is still on track , noting that HBO would now carry the television portion of the project . </P> <P> By March 2012 , Warner Bros. was expressing interested in taking on the project . Several months later , Goldsman delivered a new script for the first film to Warner Bros. , and the studio had to make a decision in August 2012 whether to go ahead with the project . As well , Russell Crowe was being talked about as the lead character . On August 20 , 2012 , Warner Bros. officially passed . At the same time , Media Rights Capital ( MRC ) was in talks to take over the project from Warner . </P> <P> In January 2014 , Aaron Paul stated that he had a conversation with Howard and was possibly being considered to play Eddie Dean ( earlier , in October 2012 , Paul had tweeted that the role of Eddie Dean was a `` huge dream '' of his ) . Following that , a rumor appeared that Liam Neeson was interested in the part of Roland . </P> <H3> Nikolaj Arcel ( 2015 -- 2017 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> On April 10 , 2015 , it was announced that Sony Pictures Entertainment with MRC were fast - tracking the project , now with a completely reworked script by Goldsman and Jeff Pinkner . King appeared optimistic , saying : `` I 'm excited that The Dark Tower is finally going to appear on the screen . '' Howard appeared to be out as director , but would remain in a producing capacity . By June 2 , 2015 , Sony was looking to Nikolaj Arcel to direct . Arcel officially signed on July 10 , 2015 , with him and Anders Thomas Jensen rewriting the script . On August 5 , 2015 , Sony Pictures Entertainment set the film for a release of January 13 , 2017 . By November 2015 , Matthew McConaughey had been offered the role of the Man in Black ( also known as Randall Flagg from The Stand , another role McConaughey had been offered in an upcoming adaptation ) . In January 2016 , it was officially announced that Idris Elba has been cast to play Roland Deschain . </P> <P> By February 18 , 2016 , Abbey Lee had been offered the female lead role of Tirana . On March 1 , 2016 , Entertainment Weekly confirmed the casting of Idris Elba as Roland and Matthew McConaughey as The Man in Black , with shooting set to begin in South Africa in April . On March 5 , Sony announced that the film would move back on the schedule from January 13 to February 17 . By March 10 , 2016 , Tom Taylor had been cast as Jake Chambers . Filming began on April 12 , 2016 . Abbey Lee , Jackie Earle Haley , and Fran Kranz were added to the cast when filming commenced , while Katheryn Winnick and Michael Barbieri joined the film at the end of April 2016 , and Claudia Kim was cast as Arra Champignon in May 2016 . After poor initial test screenings , Sony contemplated replacing Arcel with `` a more experienced filmmaker , '' but instead producers Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman advised Arcel on cleaning up the music and narrative of the film . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Dark Tower began filming in South Africa in April 2016 . The film also shot scenes in New York . In October 2016 , the film was screened to test audiences with negative results , with many labeling it confusing and messy . In response , Sony and MRC spent $6 million on reshoots to provide Deschain 's backstory . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> At one point , the film was scheduled to be released on February 17 , 2017 . In November 2016 , the film was pushed back to July 28 , 2017 , after the studio 's Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle was moved from that date . In late March 2017 , the film was pushed back again to August 4 , 2017 , switching places with Sony Pictures Animation 's The Emoji Movie . </P> <H3> Promotion ( edit ) </H3> <P> An unfinished rough cut of the first trailer leaked online on October 10 , 2016 , but was later taken down almost all over the internet . On May 3 , 2017 , a full length trailer was released . </P> <P> A one - minute television spot titled Connected KINGdom featured Easter eggs of other Stephen King stories through the inter-dimensional setting of the titular location , the Dark Tower . Various references included The Shining ( 1980 ) , Christine ( 1983 ) , Cujo ( 1983 ) , Misery ( 1990 ) , The Shawshank Redemption ( 1994 ) , Carrie , and It . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Box office ( edit ) </H3> <P> As of September 18 , 2017 , The Dark Tower has grossed $50 million in the United States and Canada and $59.9 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $109.9 million , against a production budget of $60 million . </P> <P> In North America , The Dark Tower was released alongside the opening of Kidnap , as well as the wide expansion of Detroit , and was projected to gross around $20 million from 3,451 theaters in its opening weekend . It made $1.8 million from Thursday previews at 2,770 theaters , with screenings beginning at 7 : 19 p.m. as an ode to the 19 : 19 of Stephen King lore present in the book series , and $7.7 million on its first day . The film went on to debut to $19.5 million , dethroning two - time defender Dunkirk as the top film at the box office , although it was the second lowest gross for a film to finish number one in all of 2017 . In its second weekend the film dropped 58.9 % to $7.9 million , finishing 4th at the box office . </P> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> Critics called The Dark Tower `` boring and flavorless '' and `` incomprehensible to newbies and wildly unfaithful and simplistic to fans of King 's books . '' On Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 16 % based on 187 reviews , with an average rating of 4 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , `` Go then , there are other Stephen King adaptations than these . '' On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100 , based on 46 critics , indicating `` generally unfavorable reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` B '' on an A+ to F scale . </P> <P> TheWrap 's Dan Callahan was critical of the film 's sloppiness and poor editing , saying , `` The 95 - minute culmination of years - long efforts to bring The Dark Tower to the big screen is a complete disaster , a limp , barely coherent shell of a movie . '' Mike Ryan of Uproxx also criticized the incoherent plot , writing , `` I 've been told that The Dark Tower books are jam - packed with dense plot , wonderful characters , and a sprawling mythology -- which is what made the movie so hard to make for all these years . Well , the solution seems to have been to just scrap all that and release a shockingly short 95 - minute movie that just kind of glosses over everything to the point that has any meaning or purpose . '' Eric Vespe of Ai n't It Cool News praised Elba 's performance , but said the actor was let down by the decision to make Roland a supporting character : `` That puts us in a weird position because Elba 's a good Roland in a movie that does n't allow him to actually embody the character in any meaningful way . He 's undercut at every turn . The strongest stuff in the film is when Roland and Jake are bonding , but that relationship is so accelerated that there 's no room for an arc . '' Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club maintained that the film was `` ultimately done in by professionalism ; it 's a movie that does n't seem to love itself , sidestepping its innate strangeness . ( ... ) If you 're making a movie about weaponized psychic kids , Luciferian wizards , and gun - nut knight - cowboys from another dimension , and your only goal is to get from act one to act three as efficiently as possible , what 's the point ? '' Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described the film as a `` major misfire '' and an `` unholy mess that should n't happen to a King , much less a paying customer '' . Writing for the Chicago Sun - Times , Richard Roeper panned the film with its criticism on the cinematography , special effects and dialogue , referring it as `` dull '' , `` mediocre '' , and `` stilted '' while calling Matthew McConaughey 's performance as the lead villain `` terrible '' and calling it `` the film 's unfortunate elements '' . </P> <P> Vox 's Aja Romano wrote that the film 's disjointed narrative structure , favouring fast - paced action over exposition and backstory , gave it a `` basic , wondrous glee '' that made it `` feel more like a Stephen King film than any other Stephen King film since Stand By Me '' , and applauded its faithfulness to King 's fictional multiverse , an idea usually discarded by adaptations . </P> <H2> Future ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Television series ( edit ) </H3> <P> By September 2016 , a television series was scheduled to be released in 2018 , with Glen Mazzara as showrunner . Elba and Taylor are set to reprise their roles as Roland and Jake respectively . The series has been confirmed to fill in the backstory to the film , being based on King 's The Dark Tower IV : Wizard and Glass , The Dark Tower : The Wind Through the Keyhole and elements of The Dark Tower : The Gunslinger , with a new actor playing young Roland , and Haysbert attached to return as Steven Deschain . Mazzara said that the series will explore `` how Walter became the Man in Black , and how their rivalry cost Roland everything and everyone he ever loved '' , though Mcconaughey 's involvement is not locked in . </P> <H3> Sequel ( edit ) </H3> <P> In an interview with Collider , King expressed hope for a sequel film in addition to the television series , suggesting that it should be R - rated , have Roland wearing a hat , and include the `` lobstrosities '' from The Dark Tower II : The Drawing of the Three . In an interview with ComingSoon.net , Arcel confirmed that The Drawing of the Three would form the basis for the sequel , and that Eddie and Susannah would appear alongside Elba , McConaughey , Taylor and Haley reprising their roles as Roland , Walter , Jake and Sayre respectively . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` THE DARK TOWER ( 12A ) '' .

Spoken by over 10 million people , it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic . Czech is closely related to Slovak , to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree . Like other Slavic languages , Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order . Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin and German . </P> <P> The Czech -- Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period , and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech -- Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period . In the later 18th to mid-19th century , the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival . The main vernacular , known as Common Czech , is based on the vernacular of Prague , but is now spoken throughout most of the Czech Republic . The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech , although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak . </P> <P> Czech has a moderately - sized phoneme inventory , comprising ten monophthongs , three diphthongs and 25 consonants ( divided into `` hard '' , `` neutral '' and `` soft '' categories ) . Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether . Czech has a raised alveolar trill , which is not known to occur as a phoneme in any other language , represented by the grapheme ř . Czech uses a simple orthography which phonologists have used as a model . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Classification </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Medieval / Old Czech </Li> <Li> 2.2 Early Modern Czech </Li> <Li> 2.3 Modern Czech </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Geographic distribution <Ul> <Li> 3.1 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Standard Czech <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Phonology </Li> <Li> 4.2 Grammar <Ul> <Li> 4.2. 1 Sentence and clause structure </Li> <Li> 4.2. 2 Declension </Li> <Li> 4.2. 3 Verb conjugation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.3 Orthography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Varieties <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Common Czech </Li> <Li> 5.2 Bohemian dialects </Li> <Li> 5.3 Moravian dialects </Li> <Li> 5.4 Sample </Li> <Li> 5.5 Mutual intelligibility </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Vocabulary </Li> <Li> 7 Sample text </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Classification ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Czech - Slovak languages and West Slavic Classification of Czech within the Balto - Slavic branch of the Indo - European language family . Czech and Slovak make up a `` Czech -- Slovak '' subgroup . <P> Czech is a member of the West Slavic sub-branch of the Slavic branch of the Indo - European language family . This branch includes Polish , Kashubian , Upper and Lower Sorbian and Slovak . Slovak is the closest language genetic neighbor of Czech , followed by Polish and Silesian . </P> <P> The West Slavic languages are spoken in Central Europe . Czech is distinguished from other West Slavic languages by a more - restricted distinction between `` hard '' and `` soft '' consonants ( see Phonology below ) . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> The Bible of Kralice was the first complete translation of the Bible into the Czech language from the original languages . Its six volumes were first published between 1579 and 1593 . Main article : History of the Czech language See also : History of the Czech lands <H3> Medieval / Old Czech ( edit ) </H3> <P> The term `` Old Czech '' is applied to the period predating the 16th century , with the earliest records of the high medieval period also classified as `` early Old Czech '' , but the term `` Medieval Czech '' is also used . </P> <P> Around the 7th century , the Slavic expansion reached Central Europe , settling on the eastern fringes of the Frankish Empire . The West Slavic polity of Great Moravia formed by the 9th century . The Christianization of Bohemia took place during the 9th and 10th centuries . The diversification of the Czech - Slovak group within West Slavic began around that time , marked among other things by its ephemeral use of the voiced velar fricative consonant ( / ɣ / ) and consistent stress on the first syllable . </P> <P> The Bohemian ( Czech ) language is first recorded in writing in glosses and short notes during the 12th to 13th centuries . Literary works written in Czech appear in the early 14th century and administrative documents first appear towards the late 14th century . The first complete Bible translation also dates to this period . Old Czech texts , including poetry and cookbooks , were produced outside the university as well . </P> <P> Literary activity becomes widespread in the early 15th century in the context of the Bohemian Reformation . Jan Hus contributed significantly to the standardization of Czech orthography , advocated for widespread literacy among Czech commoners ( particularly in religion ) and made early efforts to model written Czech after the spoken language . </P> <H3> Early modern Czech ( edit ) </H3> <P> There was no standardization distinguishing between Czech and Slovak prior to the 15th century . In the 16th century , the division between Czech and Slovak becomes apparent , marking the confessional division between Lutheran Protestants in Slovakia using Czech orthography and Catholics , especially Slovak Jesuits , beginning to use a separate Slovak orthography based on the language of the Trnava region . </P> <P> The publication of the Kralice Bible between 1579 and 1593 ( the first complete Czech translation of the Bible from the original languages ) became very important for standardization of the Czech language in the following centuries . </P> <P> In 1615 , the Bohemian diet tried to declare Czech to be the only official language of the kingdom . After the Bohemian Revolt ( of predominantly Protestant aristocracy ) which was defeated by the Habsburgs in 1620 , the Protestant intellectuals had to leave the country . This emigration together with other consequences of the Thirty Years ' War had a negative impact on the further use of the Czech language . In 1627 , Czech and German became official languages of the Kingdom of Bohemia and in the 18th century German became dominant in Bohemia and Moravia , especially among the upper classes . </P> <H3> Modern Czech ( edit ) </H3> Josef Dobrovský , whose writing played a key role in reviving Czech as a written language See also : Czech National Revival <P> The modern standard Czech language originates in standardization efforts of the 18th century . By then the language had developed a literary tradition , and since then it has changed little ; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech , and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty . Changes include the morphological shift of í to ej and é to í ( although é survives for some uses ) and the merging of í and the former ejí . Sometime before the 18th century , the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic / l / and / ʎ / which survives in Slovak . </P> Prohibition signs written in Czech , by entry # 3 into the building of National Technical Library in Prague . <P> With the beginning of the national revival of the mid-18th century , Czech historians began to emphasize their people 's accomplishments from the 15th through the 17th centuries , rebelling against the Counter-Reformation ( the Habsburg re-catholization efforts which had denigrated Czech and other non-Latin languages ) . Czech philologists studied sixteenth - century texts , advocating the return of the language to high culture . This period is known as the Czech National Revival ( or Renaissance ) . </P> <P> During the national revival , in 1809 linguist and historian Josef Dobrovský released a German - language grammar of Old Czech entitled Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der böhmischen Sprache ( Comprehensive Doctrine of the Bohemian Language ) . Dobrovský had intended his book to be descriptive , and did not think Czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language . However , Josef Jungmann and other revivalists used Dobrovský 's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic revival . Changes during this time included spelling reform ( notably , í in place of the former j and j in place of g ) , the use of t ( rather than ti ) to end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns ( which had been a late borrowing from German ) . These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak . Modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal , widespread use . </P> <P> Adherence to historical patterns was later relaxed and standard Czech adopted a number of features from Common Czech ( a widespread , informal register ) , such as leaving some proper nouns undeclined . This has resulted in a relatively high level of homogeneity among all varieties of the language . </P> <H2> Geographic distribution ( edit ) </H2> A map of the languages of Central and Eastern Europe . Within the Czech Republic , Common Czech is represented by dark yellow ( C1 ) and Moravian dialects by medium yellow ( C2 ) and light green ( C3 ) . Official use of Czech in Vojvodina , Serbia <P> In 2005 and 2007 , Czech was spoken by about 10 million residents of the Czech Republic . A Eurobarometer survey conducted from January to March 2012 found that the first language of 98 percent of Czech citizens was Czech , the third - highest in the European Union ( behind Greece and Hungary ) . </P> <P> Czech , the official language of the Czech Republic ( a member of the European Union since 2004 ) , is one of the EU 's official languages and the 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that Czech was the foreign language most often used in Slovakia . Economist Jonathan van Parys collected data on language knowledge in Europe for the 2012 European Day of Languages . The five countries with the greatest use of Czech were the Czech Republic ( 98.77 percent ) , Slovakia ( 24.86 percent ) , Portugal ( 1.93 percent ) , Poland ( 0.98 percent ) and Germany ( 0.47 percent ) . </P> <P> Czech speakers in Slovakia primarily live in cities . Since it is a recognised minority language in Slovakia , Slovak citizens who speak only Czech may communicate with the government in their language to the extent that Slovak speakers in the Czech Republic may do so . </P> <H3> United states ( edit ) </H3> See also : Czech American and Czech Texan <P> Immigration of Czechs from Europe to the United States occurred primarily from 1848 to 1914 . Czech is a Less Commonly Taught Language in U.S. schools , and is taught at Czech heritage centers . Large communities of Czech Americans live in the states of Texas , Nebraska and Wisconsin . In the 2000 United States Census , Czech was reported as the most - common language spoken at home ( besides English ) in Valley , Butler and Saunders Counties , Nebraska and Republic County , Kansas . With the exception of Spanish ( the non-English language most commonly spoken at home nationwide ) , Czech was the most - common home language in over a dozen additional counties in Nebraska , Kansas , Texas , North Dakota and Minnesota . As of 2009 , 70,500 Americans spoke Czech as their first language ( 49th place nationwide , behind Turkish and ahead of Swedish ) . </P> <H2> Standard Czech ( edit ) </H2> <P> The modern written standard is directly based on the standardization during the Czech National Revival in the 1830s , significantly influenced by Josef Jungmann 's Czech -- German dictionary published during 1834 -- 1839 . Jungmann used vocabulary of the Bible of Kralice ( 1579 -- 1613 ) period and of the language used by his contemporaries . He borrowed words not present in Czech from other Slavic languages or created neologisms . </P> <H3> Phonology ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Czech phonology Spoken Czech <P> Standard Czech contains ten basic vowel phonemes , and three more found only in loanwords . They are / a / , / ɛ / , / ɪ / , / o / , and / u / , their long counterparts / aː / , / ɛː / , / iː / , / oː / and / uː / , and three diphthongs , / ou̯ / , / au̯ / and / ɛu̯ / . The latter two diphthongs and the long / oː / are exclusive to loanwords . Vowels are never reduced to schwa sounds when unstressed . Each word usually has primary stress on its first syllable , except for enclitics ( minor , monosyllabic , unstressed syllables ) . In all words of more than two syllables , every odd - numbered syllable receives secondary stress . Stress is unrelated to vowel length , and the possibility of stressed short vowels and unstressed long vowels can be confusing to students whose native language combines the features ( such as English ) . </P> <P> Voiced consonants with unvoiced counterparts are unvoiced at the end of a word before a pause , and in consonant clusters voicing assimilation occurs , which matches voicing to the following consonant . The unvoiced counterpart of / ɦ / is / x / . </P> <P> Czech consonants are categorized as `` hard '' , `` neutral '' or `` soft '' : </P> <Ul> <Li> Hard : / d / , / ɡ / , / ɦ / , / k / , / n / , / r / , / t / , / x / </Li> <Li> Neutral : / b / , / f / , / l / , / m / , / p / , / s / , / v / , / z / </Li> <Li> Soft : / c / , / ɟ / , / j / , / ɲ / , / r̝ / , / ʃ / , / ts / , / tʃ / , / ʒ / </Li> </Ul> <P> This distinction describes the declension patterns of nouns , which is based on the category of a noun 's ending consonant . Hard consonants may not be followed by i or í in writing , or soft ones by y or ý ( except in loanwords such as kilogram ) . Neutral consonants may take either character . Hard consonants are sometimes known as `` strong '' , and soft ones as `` weak '' . </P> <P> The phoneme represented by the letter ř ( capital Ř ) is considered unique to Czech . It represents the raised alveolar non-sonorant trill ( IPA : ( r̝ ) ) , a sound somewhere between Czech 's r and ž ( example : `` řeka '' ( river ) ( help info ) ) , and is present in Dvořák . In unvoiced environments , / r̝ / is realized as its voiceless allophone ( r̝̊ ) . </P> <P> The consonants / r / and / l / can be syllabic , acting as syllable nuclei in place of a vowel . Strč prst skrz krk ( `` Stick ( your ) finger through ( your ) throat '' ) is a well - known Czech tongue twister using only syllabic consonants . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <P> Consonants </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> </Th> <Th> Labial </Th> <Th> Alveolar </Th> <Th> Post - alveolar </Th> <Th> Palatal </Th> <Th> Velar </Th> <Th> Glottal </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Nasal </Th> <Td> m </Td> <Td> n </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> ɲ </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Plosive </Th> <Th> voiceless </Th> <Td> p </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> k </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> voiced </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> d </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> ɟ </Td> <Td> ( ɡ ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Affricate </Th> <Th> voiceless </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> t͡s </Td> <Td> t͡ʃ </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> voiced </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> ( d͡z ) </Td> <Td> ( d͡ʒ ) </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Fricative </Th> <Th> voiceless </Th> <Td> ( f ) </Td> <Td> s </Td> <Td> ʃ </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> x </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> voiced </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> z </Td> <Td> ʒ </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> ɦ </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Trill </Th> <Th> plain </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> r </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> fricative </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> r̝ </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Approximant </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> l </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> j </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> <Td> <P> Vowels </P> A Czech vowel chart </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Grammar ( edit ) </H3> <P> Slavic grammar is fusional ; its nouns , verbs , and adjectives are inflected by phonological processes to modify their meanings and grammatical functions , and the easily separable affixes characteristic of agglutinative languages are limited . Slavic inflection is complex and pervasive , inflecting for case , gender and number in nouns and tense , aspect , mood , person and subject number and gender in verbs . </P> <P> Parts of speech include adjectives , adverbs , numbers , interrogative words , prepositions , conjunctions and interjections . Adverbs are primarily formed from adjectives by taking the final ý or í of the base form and replacing it with e , ě , or o . Negative statements are formed by adding the affix ne - to the verb of a clause , with one exception : je ( he , she or it is ) becomes není . </P> Sentence and clause structure ( edit ) See also : Czech word order <Table> Czech pronouns , nominative case <Tr> <Th> Person </Th> <Th> Singular </Th> <Th> Plural </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 1 . </Th> <Td> já </Td> <Td> my </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 2 . </Th> <Td> ty vy ( formal ) </Td> <Td> vy </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 3 . </Th> <Td> on ( masculine ) ona ( feminine ) ono ( neuter ) </Td> <Td> oni ( masculine ) ony ( feminine ) ona ( neuter ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Because Czech uses grammatical case to convey word function in a sentence ( instead of relying on word order , as English does ) , its word order is flexible . As a pro-drop language , in Czech an intransitive sentence can consist of only a verb ; information about its subject is encoded in the verb . Enclitics ( primarily auxiliary verbs and pronouns ) must appear in the second syntactic slot of a sentence , after the first stressed unit . The first slot must contain a subject and object , a main form of a verb , an adverb or a conjunction ( except for the light conjunctions a , `` and '' , i , `` and even '' or ale , `` but '' ) . </P> <P> Czech syntax has a subject -- verb -- object sentence structure . In practice , however , word order is flexible and used for topicalization and focus . Although Czech has a periphrastic passive construction ( like English ) , colloquial word - order changes frequently produce the passive voice . For example , to change `` Peter killed Paul '' to `` Paul was killed by Peter '' the order of subject and object is inverted : Petr zabil Pavla ( `` Peter killed Paul '' ) becomes `` Paul , Peter killed '' ( Pavla zabil Petr ) . Pavla is in the accusative case , the grammatical object ( in this case , the victim ) of the verb . </P> <P> A word at the end of a clause is typically emphasized , unless an upward intonation indicates that the sentence is a question : </P> <Ul> <Li> Pes jí bagetu . -- The dog eats the baguette ( rather than eating something else ) . </Li> <Li> Bagetu jí pes . -- The dog eats the baguette ( rather than someone else doing so ) . </Li> <Li> Pes bagetu jí . -- The dog eats the baguette ( rather than doing something else to it ) . </Li> <Li> Jí pes bagetu ? -- Does the dog eat the baguette ? ( emphasis ambiguous ) </Li> </Ul> <P> In portions of Bohemia ( including Prague ) , questions such as Jí pes bagetu ? without an interrogative word ( such as co , `` what '' or kdo , `` who '' ) are intoned in a slow rise from low to high , quickly dropping to low on the last word or phrase . </P> <P> In modern Czech syntax , adjectives precede nouns , with few exceptions . Relative clauses are introduced by relativizers such as the adjective který , analogous to the English relative pronouns `` which '' , `` that '' , `` who '' and `` whom '' . As with other adjectives , it is declined into the appropriate case ( see Declension below ) to match its associated noun , person and number . Relative clauses follow the noun they modify , and the following is a glossed example : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Czech : </Td> <Td> Chc - i </Td> <Td> navštív - it </Td> <Td> univerzit - u , </Td> <Td> na </Td> <Td> kter - ou </Td> <Td> chod - í </Td> <Td> Jan . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Gloss : </Td> <Td> want-1.SG </Td> <Td> visit - INF </Td> <Td> university - SG.

NOM </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> English : I want to visit the university that John attends . </P> Declension ( edit ) Main article : Czech declension <P> In Czech , nouns and adjectives are declined into one of seven grammatical cases . Nouns are inflected to indicate their use in a sentence . A nominative -- accusative language , Czech marks subject nouns with nominative case and object nouns with accusative case . The genitive case marks possessive nouns and some types of movement . The remaining cases ( instrumental , locative , vocative and dative ) indicate semantic relationships , such as secondary objects , movement or position ( dative case ) and accompaniment ( instrumental case ) . An adjective 's case agrees with that of the noun it describes . When Czech children learn their language 's declension patterns , the cases are referred to by number : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Ordinal name ( Czech ) </Th> <Th> Full name ( Czech ) </Th> <Th> Case </Th> <Th> Main usage </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 . </Td> <Td> první pád </Td> <Td> nominativ </Td> <Td> nominative </Td> <Td> Subjects </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2 . </Td> <Td> druhý pád </Td> <Td> genitiv </Td> <Td> genitive </Td> <Td> Belonging , movement away from something ( or someone ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3 . </Td> <Td> třetí pád </Td> <Td> dativ </Td> <Td> dative </Td> <Td> Indirect objects , movement toward something ( or someone ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4 . </Td> <Td> čtvrtý pád </Td> <Td> akuzativ </Td> <Td> accusative </Td> <Td> Direct objects </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 . </Td> <Td> pátý pád </Td> <Td> vokativ </Td> <Td> vocative </Td> <Td> Addressing someone </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6 . </Td> <Td> šestý pád </Td> <Td> lokál </Td> <Td> locative </Td> <Td> Location </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 7 . </Td> <Td> sedmý pád </Td> <Td> instrumentál </Td> <Td> instrumental </Td> <Td> Being used for a task ; acting with someone ( or something ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Some Czech grammatical texts order the cases differently , grouping the nominative and accusative ( and the dative and locative ) together because those declension patterns are often identical ; this order accommodates learners with experience in other inflected languages , such as Latin or Russian . This order is nominative , accusative , genitive , dative , locative , instrumental and vocative . </P> <P> Some prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case . The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical ( or metaphorical ) direction , or location , conveyed by it . For example , od ( from , away from ) and z ( out of , off ) assign the genitive case . Other prepositions take one of several cases , with their meaning dependent on the case ; na means `` onto '' or `` for '' with the accusative case , but `` on '' with the locative . </P> <P> Examples of declension patterns ( using prepositions ) for a few nouns with adjectives follow .

With few exceptions , feminine nouns in the nominative case end in - a , - e , or - ost ; neuter nouns in - o , - e , or - í , and masculine nouns in a consonant . Adjectives agree in gender and animacy ( for masculine nouns in the accusative or genitive singular and the nominative plural ) with the nouns they modify . The main effect of gender in Czech is the difference in noun and adjective declension , but other effects include past - tense verb endings : for example , dělal ( he did , or made ) ; dělala ( she did , or made ) and dělalo ( it did , or made ) . </P> <P> Nouns are also inflected for number , distinguishing between singular and plural . Typical of a Slavic language , Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case , but numbers over five place these nouns and adjectives in the genitive case when the entire expression is in nominative or accusative case . The Czech koruna is an example of this feature ; it is shown here as the subject of a hypothetical sentence , and declined as genitive for numbers five and up . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> English </Th> <Th> Czech </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> one crown </Td> <Td> jedna koruna </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> two crowns </Td> <Td> dvě koruny </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> three crowns </Td> <Td> tři koruny </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> four crowns </Td> <Td> čtyři koruny </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> five crowns </Td> <Td> pět korun </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Numerical words decline for case and , for numbers one and two , for gender . Numbers one through five are shown below as examples , and have some of the most exceptions among Czech numbers .

Some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases : ruka ( hand ) -- ruce ( nominative ) ; noha ( leg ) -- nohama ( instrumental ) , nohou ( genitive / locative ) ; oko ( eye ) -- oči , and ucho ( ear ) -- uši . While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms , all plural forms are considered feminine ; their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs . These forms are plural semantically , used for any non-singular count , as in mezi čtyřma očima ( face to face , lit . among four eyes ) . The plural number paradigms of these nouns are actually a mixture of historical dual and plural forms . For example , nohy ( legs ; nominative / accusative ) is a standard plural form of this type of noun . </P> Verb conjugation ( edit ) Main articles : Czech conjugation and Morphological classification of Czech verbs See also : Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages <P> Czech verb conjugation is less complex than noun and adjective declension because it codes for fewer categories . Verbs agree with their subjects in person ( first , second or third ) and number ( singular or plural ) , and are conjugated for tense ( past , present or future ) . For example , the conjugated verb mluvíme ( we speak ) is in the present tense and first - person plural ; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the infinitive mluvit by its ending , - íme . </P> <P> Typical of Slavic languages , Czech marks its verbs for one of two grammatical aspects : perfective and imperfective . Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairs -- for example , koupit ( perfective ) and kupovat ( imperfective ) . Although the verbs ' meaning is similar , in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing . This is distinct from past and present tense , and any Czech verb of either aspect can be conjugated into any of its three tenses . Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense . </P> <P> The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways : by prefix or by suffix . In prefix pairs , the perfective verb has an added prefix -- for example , the imperfective psát ( to write , to be writing ) compared with the perfective napsat ( to write down , to finish writing ) . The most common prefixes are na - , o - , po - , s - , u - , vy - , z - and za - . In suffix pairs , a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem ; for example , the perfective verbs koupit ( to buy ) and prodat ( to sell ) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodávat . Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs ( iterative and frequentative forms ) , denoting repeated or regular action . The verb jít ( to go ) has the iterative form chodit ( to go repeatedly ) and the frequentative form chodívat ( to go regularly ) . </P> <P> Many verbs have only one aspect , and verbs describing continual states of being -- být ( to be ) , chtít ( to want ) , moct ( to be able to ) , ležet ( to lie down , to be lying down ) -- have no perfective form . Conversely , verbs describing immediate states of change -- for example , otěhotnět ( to become pregnant ) and nadchnout se ( to become enthusiastic ) -- have no imperfective aspect . </P> <P> Although Czech 's use of present and future tense is largely similar to that of English , the language uses past tense to represent the English present perfect and past perfect ; ona běžela could mean she ran , she has run or she had run . </P> <Table> Conjugation of být in future tense <Tr> <Th> Person </Th> <Th> Singular </Th> <Th> Plural </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 1 . </Th> <Td> budu </Td> <Td> budeme </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 2 . </Th> <Td> budeš </Td> <Td> budete </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 3 . </Th> <Td> bude </Td> <Td> budou </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In some contexts , Czech 's perfective present ( which differs from the English present perfect ) implies future action ; in others , it connotes habitual action . As a result , the language has a proper future tense to minimize ambiguity . The future tense does not involve conjugating the verb describing an action to be undertaken in the future ; instead , the future form of být ( as shown in the table at left ) is placed before the infinitive ( for example , budu jíst -- `` I will eat '' ) . </P> <P> This conjugation is not followed by být itself , so future - oriented expressions involving nouns , adjectives , or prepositions ( rather than verbs ) omit být . `` I will be happy '' is translated as Budu šťastný ( not Budu být šťastný ) . </P> <Table> Conditional form of koupit ( to buy ) <Tr> <Th> Person </Th> <Th> Singular </Th> <Th> Plural </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 1 . </Th> <Td> koupil / a bych </Td> <Td> koupili / y bychom </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 2 . </Th> <Td> koupil / a bys </Td> <Td> koupili / y byste </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 3 . </Th> <Td> koupil / a / o by </Td> <Td> koupili / y / a by </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The infinitive form ends in t ( archaically , ti ) . It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs ( for example , můžu tě slyšet -- `` I can hear you '' ) . Czech verbs have three grammatical moods : indicative , imperative and conditional . The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person ( or number ) categories : - Ø / - i / - ej for second - person singular , - te / - ete / - ejte for second - person plural and - me / - eme / - ejme for first - person plural . The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past - tense verb . This mood indicates possible events , expressed in English as `` I would '' or `` I wish '' . </P> <P> Most Czech verbs fall into one of five classes , which determine their conjugation patterns . The future tense of být would be classified as a Class I verb because of its endings . Examples of the present tense of each class and some common irregular verbs follow in the tables below : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Table> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Th> Class I </Th> <Th> Class II </Th> <Th> Class III </Th> <Th> Class IV </Th> <Th> Class V </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Definition </Th> <Td> to carry </Td> <Td> to print </Td> <Td> to wander </Td> <Td> to suffer </Td> <Td> to do , to make </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Infinitive </Th> <Td> nést </Td> <Td> tisknout </Td> <Td> putovat </Td> <Td> trpět </Td> <Td> dělat </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 1st p. sg . </Th> <Td> nesu </Td> <Td> tisknu </Td> <Td> putuji </Td> <Td> trpím </Td> <Td> dělám </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 2nd p. sg . </Th> <Td> neseš </Td> <Td> tiskneš </Td> <Td> putuješ </Td> <Td> trpíš </Td> <Td> děláš </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 3rd p. sg . </Th> <Td> nese </Td> <Td> tiskne </Td> <Td> putuje </Td> <Td> trpí </Td> <Td> dělá </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 1st p. pl . </Th> <Td> neseme </Td> <Td> tiskneme </Td> <Td> putujeme </Td> <Td> trpíme </Td> <Td> děláme </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 2nd p. pl . </Th> <Td> nesete </Td> <Td> tisknete </Td> <Td> putujete </Td> <Td> trpíte </Td> <Td> děláte </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 3rd p. pl . </Th> <Td> nesou </Td> <Td> tisknou </Td> <Td> putují </Td> <Td> trpí </Td> <Td> dělají </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> <Td> <Table> Irregular verbs <Tr> <Th> Definition </Th> <Td> to be </Td> <Td> to want </Td> <Td> to eat </Td> <Td> to know </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Infinitive </Th> <Td> být </Td> <Td> chtít </Td> <Td> jíst </Td> <Td> vědět </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 1st p. sg . </Th> <Td> jsem </Td> <Td> chci </Td> <Td> jím </Td> <Td> vím </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 2nd p. sg . </Th> <Td> jsi </Td> <Td> chceš </Td> <Td> jíš </Td> <Td> víš </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 3rd p. sg . </Th> <Td> je </Td> <Td> chce </Td> <Td> jí </Td> <Td> ví </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 1st p. pl . </Th> <Td> jsme </Td> <Td> chceme </Td> <Td> jíme </Td> <Td> víme </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 2nd p. pl . </Th> <Td> jste </Td> <Td> chcete </Td> <Td> jíte </Td> <Td> víte </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 3rd p. pl . </Th> <Td> jsou </Td> <Td> chtějí </Td> <Td> jedí </Td> <Td> vědí </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Orthography ( edit ) </H3> The handwritten Czech alphabet Main article : Czech orthography See also : Czech Braille <P> Czech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages . Its thirty - one graphemes represent thirty sounds ( in most dialects , i and y have the same sound ) , and it contains only one digraph : ch , which follows h in the alphabet . As a result , some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages . The characters q , w and x appear only in foreign words . The háček ( ˇ ) is used with certain letters to form new characters : š , ž , and č , as well as ň , ě , ř , ť , and ď ( the latter five uncommon outside Czech ) . The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above ( ʼ , an abbreviated háček ) because of their height . The character ó exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia . </P> <P> Unlike most European languages , Czech distinguishes vowel length ; long vowels are indicated by an acute accent or , occasionally with ů , a ring . Long u is usually written ú at the beginning of a word or morpheme ( úroda , neúrodný ) and ů elsewhere , except for loanwords ( skútr ) or onomatopoeia ( bú ) . Long vowels and ě are not considered separate letters in the alphabetical order . </P> <P> Czech typographical features not associated with phonetics generally resemble those of most Latin European languages , including English . Proper nouns , honorifics , and the first letters of quotations are capitalized , and punctuation is typical of other Latin European languages . Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to most European languages . The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point . When writing a long number , spaces between every three numbers ( e.g. between hundreds and thousands ) may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts , but not in decimal places , like in English . The number 1,234,567.8910 may be written as 1234567 , 8910 or 1 234 567 , 8910 . Ordinal numbers ( 1st ) use a point as in German ( 1 . ) . In proper noun phrases ( except personal names ) , only the first word is capitalized ( Pražský hrad , Prague Castle ) . </P> <H2> Varieties ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Czech -- Slovak languages <P> The main vernacular of Bohemia is `` Common Czech '' , based on the dialect of the Prague region . Other Bohemian dialects have become marginalized , while Moravian dialects remain more widespread , with a political movement for Moravian linguistic revival active since the 1990s . </P> <H3> Common Czech ( edit ) </H3> <P> The main Czech vernacular , spoken primarily in and around Prague but also throughout the country , is known as Common Czech ( obecná čeština ) . This is an academic distinction ; most Czechs are unaware of the term or associate it with vernacular ( or incorrect ) Czech . Compared to standard Czech , Common Czech is characterized by simpler inflection patterns and differences in sound distribution . </P> <P> Common Czech has become ubiquitous in most parts of the Czech Republic since the later 20th century . It is usually defined as an interdialect used in common speech in Bohemia and western parts of Moravia ( by about two thirds of all inhabitants of the Czech Republic ) . Common Czech is not codified , but some of its elements have become adopted in the written standard . Since the second half of the 20th century , Common Czech elements have also been spreading to regions previously unaffected , as a consequence of media influence . Standard Czech is still the norm for politicians , businesspeople and other Czechs in formal situations , but Common Czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media . </P> <P> Common Czech is characterized by quite regular differences from the standard morphology and phonology . These variations are more or less common among all Common Czech speakers : </P> <Ul> <Li> é usually replaced by ý / í : malý město ( small town ) , plamínek ( little flame ) , lítat ( to fly ) ; </Li> <Li> ý ( sometimes also í ) replaced by ej : malej dům ( small house ) , mlejn ( mill ) , plejtvat ( to waste ) , bejt ( to be ) -- as a consequence of the loss of the difference in the pronunciation of y / ý and i / í in the 15th century ; </Li> <Li> unified plural endings of adjectives : malý lidi ( small people ) , malý ženy ( small women ) , malý města ( small towns ) -- stand. : malí lidé , malé ženy , malá města ; </Li> <Li> unified instrumental ending - ma in plural : s těma dobrejma lidma , ženama , chlapama , městama ( with the good people , women , guys , towns ) -- stand. : s těmi dobrými lidmi , ženami , chlapy , městy . In essence , this form resembles the form of the dual , which was once a productive form , but now is almost extinct and retained in a lexically specific set of words . In Common Czech the ending became productive again around the 17th century , but used as a substitute for a regular plural form . </Li> <Li> prothetic v - added to most words beginning o - : votevřít vokno ( to open the window ) -- stand. : otevřít okno ; but ovoce not * vovoce ( fruit ) </Li> <Li> omitting of the syllabic - l in the masculine ending of past tense verbs : řek ( he said ) , moh ( he could ) , pích ( he pricked ) -- stand. : řekl , mohl , píchl . </Li> </Ul> <P> Example of declension ( with the comparison with the standard Czech ) : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> Masculine animate </Th> <Th> Masculine inanimate </Th> <Th> Feminine </Th> <Th> Neuter </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Sg . </Th> <Th> Nominative </Th> <Td> mladej člověk mladý člověk </Td> <Td> mladej stát mladý stát </Td> <Td> mladá žena mladá žena </Td> <Td> mladý zvíře mladé zvíře </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Genitive </Th> <Td> mladýho člověka mladého člověka </Td> <Td> mladýho státu mladého státu </Td> <Td> mladý ženy mladé ženy </Td> <Td> mladýho zvířete mladého zvířete </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Dative </Th> <Td> mladýmu člověkovi mladému člověku </Td> <Td> mladýmu státu mladému státu </Td> <Td> mladý ženě mladé ženě </Td> <Td> mladýmu zvířeti mladému zvířeti </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Accusative </Th> <Td> mladýho člověka mladého člověka </Td> <Td> mladej stát mladý stát </Td> <Td> mladou ženu mladou ženu </Td> <Td> mladý zvíře mladé zvíře </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Vocative </Th> <Td> mladej člověče ! mladý člověče ! </Td> <Td> mladej státe ! mladý státe ! </Td> <Td> mladá ženo ! mladá ženo ! </Td> <Td> mladý zvíře ! mladé zvíře ! </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Locative </Th> <Td> mladym člověkovi mladém člověkovi </Td> <Td> mladym státě mladém státě </Td> <Td> mladý ženě mladé ženě </Td> <Td> mladym zvířeti mladém zvířeti </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Instrumental </Th> <Td> mladym člověkem mladým člověkem </Td> <Td> mladym státem mladým státem </Td> <Td> mladou ženou mladou ženou </Td> <Td> mladym zvířetem mladým zvířetem </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Pl . </Th> <Th> Nominative </Th> <Td> mladý lidi mladí lidé </Td> <Td> mladý státy mladé státy </Td> <Td> mladý ženy mladé ženy </Td> <Td> mladý zvířata mladá zvířata </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Genitive </Th> <Td> mladejch lidí mladých lidí </Td> <Td> mladejch států mladých států </Td> <Td> mladejch žen mladých žen </Td> <Td> mladejch zvířat mladých zvířat </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Dative </Th> <Td> mladejm lidem mladým lidem </Td> <Td> mladejm státům mladým státům </Td> <Td> mladejm ženám mladým ženám </Td> <Td> mladejm zvířatům mladým zvířatům </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Accusative </Th> <Td> mladý lidi mladé lidi </Td> <Td> mladý státy mladé státy </Td> <Td> mladý ženy mladé ženy </Td> <Td> mladý zvířata mladá zvířata </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Vocative </Th> <Td> mladý lidi ! mladí lidé ! </Td> <Td> mladý státy ! mladé státy ! </Td> <Td> mladý ženy ! mladé ženy ! </Td> <Td> mladý zvířata ! mladá zvířata ! </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Locative </Th> <Td> mladejch lidech mladých lidech </Td> <Td> mladejch státech mladých státech </Td> <Td> mladejch ženách mladých ženách </Td> <Td> mladejch zvířatech mladých zvířatech </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Instrumental </Th> <Td> mladejma lidma mladými lidmi </Td> <Td> mladejma státama mladými státy </Td> <Td> mladejma ženama mladými ženami </Td> <Td> mladejma zvířatama mladými zvířaty </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> mladý člověk -- young man / person , mladí lidé -- young people , mladý stát -- young state , mladá žena -- young woman , mladé zvíře -- young animal </P> <H3> Bohemian dialects ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Chod dialect <P> Apart from the Common Czech vernacular , there remain a variety of other Bohemian dialects , mostly in marginal rural areas . Dialect use began to weaken in the second half of the 20th century , and by the early 1990s regional dialect use was stigmatized , associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect . Increased travel and media availability to dialect - speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to ( or add to their own dialect ) standard Czech . </P> <P> The Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Bohemian dialects : </P> <Ul> <Li> Nářečí středočeská ( Central Bohemian dialects ) </Li> <Li> Nářečí jihozápadočeská ( Southwestern Bohemian dialects ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> Podskupina chodská ( Chod subgroup ) </Li> <Li> Podskupina doudlebská ( Doudleby subgroup ) </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Nářečí severovýchodočeská ( Northeastern Bohemian dialects ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> Podskupina podkrknošská ( Krkonoše subgroup ) </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> <P> Bohemian dialects use a slightly different set of vowel phonemes to standard Czech . The phoneme / ɛː / is peripheral and is replaced by / iː / , and a second native diphthong / eɪ̯ / occurs , usually in places where standard Czech has / iː / . </P> <H3> Moravian dialects ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Moravian dialects Further information : Lach dialects <P> The Czech dialects spoken in Moravia and Silesia are known as Moravian ( moravština ) . In the Austro - Hungarian Empire , `` Bohemian - Moravian - Slovak '' was a language citizens could register as speaking ( with German , Polish and several others ) . Of the Czech dialects , only Moravian is distinguished in nationwide surveys by the Czech Statistical Office . As of 2011 , 62,908 Czech citizens spoke Moravian as their first language and 45,561 were diglossal ( speaking Moravian and standard Czech as first languages ) . </P> <P> Beginning in the sixteenth century , some varieties of Czech resembled Slovak ; the southeastern Moravian dialects , in particular , are sometimes considered dialects of Slovak rather than Czech . These dialects form a continuum between the Czech and Slovak languages , using the same declension patterns for nouns and pronouns and the same verb conjugations as Slovak . </P> <P> The Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Moravian dialects : </P> <Ul> <Li> Nářečí českomoravská ( Bohemian -- Moravian dialects ) </Li> <Li> Nářečí středomoravská ( Central Moravian dialects ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> Podskupina tišnovská ( Tišnov subgroup ) </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Nářečí východomoravská ( Eastern Moravian dialects ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> Podskupina slovácká ( Moravian Slovak subgroup ) </Li> <Li> Podskupina valašská ( Moravian Wallachian subgroup ) </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Nářečí slezská ( Silesian dialects ) </Li> </Ul> <H3> Sample ( edit ) </H3> <P> In a 1964 textbook on Czech dialectology , Břetislav Koudela used the following sentence to highlight phonetic differences between dialects : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Standard Czech : </Td> <Td> Dej mouku ze mlýna na vozík . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Common Czech : </Td> <Td> Dej mouku ze mlejna na vozejk . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Central Moravian : </Td> <Td> Dé móku ze mléna na vozék . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Eastern Moravian : </Td> <Td> Daj múku ze młýna na vozík . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Silesian : </Td> <Td> Daj muku ze młyna na vozik . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Slovak : </Td> <Td> Daj múku zm lyna na vozík . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> English : </Td> <Td> Put the flour from the mill into the cart . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Mutual intelligibility ( edit ) </H3> <P> Czech and Slovak have been considered mutually intelligible ; speakers of either language can communicate with greater ease than those of any other pair of West Slavic languages . Since the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia , mutual intelligibility has declined for younger speakers , probably because Czech speakers now experience less exposure to Slovak and vice versa . </P> <P> In phonetic differences , Czech is characterized by a glottal stop before initial vowels and Slovak by its less - frequent use of long vowels than Czech ; however , Slovak has long forms of the consonants r and l when they function as vowels . Phonemic differences between the two languages are generally consistent , typical of two dialects of a language . Grammatically , although Czech ( unlike Slovak ) has a fully productive vocative case , both languages share a common syntax . </P> <P> One study showed that Czech and Slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent , but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation ; Slovak morphology is more regular ( when changing from the nominative to the locative case , Praha becomes Praze in Czech and Prahe in Slovak ) . The two lexicons are generally considered similar , with most differences found in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology . Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech . </P> <P> The similarities between Czech and Slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th - century scholars who called themselves `` Czechoslavs '' ( Čechoslované ) , believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded German Bohemians and ( to a lesser extent ) Hungarians and other Slavs . During the First Czechoslovak Republic ( 1918 -- 1938 ) , although `` Czechoslovak '' was designated as the republic 's official language , both Czech and Slovak written standards were used . Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech , and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic . Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars , and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State ( which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II ) , literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech . When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed , Slovak developed somewhat on its own ( with Czech influence ) ; during the Prague Spring of 1968 , Slovak gained independence from ( and equality with ) Czech , due to the transformation of Czechoslovakia from a unitary state to a federation . Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993 , `` Czechoslovak '' has referred to improvised pidgins of the languages which have arisen from the decrease in mutual intelligibility . </P> <H2> Vocabulary ( edit ) </H2> See also : List of English words of Czech origin <P> Czech vocabulary derives primarily from Slavic , Baltic and other Indo - European roots . Although most verbs have Balto - Slavic origins , pronouns , prepositions and some verbs have wider , Indo - European roots . Some loanwords have been restructured by folk etymology to resemble native Czech words ( hřbitov , `` graveyard '' and listina , `` list '' ) . </P> <P> Most Czech loanwords originated in one of two time periods . Earlier loanwords , primarily from German , Greek and Latin , arrived before the Czech National Revival . More recent loanwords derive primarily from English and French , and also from Hebrew , Arabic and Persian . Many Russian loanwords , principally animal names and naval terms , also exist in Czech . </P> <P> Although older German loanwords were colloquial , recent borrowings from other languages are associated with high culture . During the nineteenth century , words with Greek and Latin roots were rejected in favor of those based on older Czech words and common Slavic roots ; `` music '' is muzyka in Polish and музыка ( muzyka ) in Russian , but in Czech it is hudba . Some Czech words have been borrowed as loanwords into English and other languages -- for example , robot ( from robota , `` labor '' ) and polka ( from polka , `` Polish woman '' or from `` půlka '' `` half '' ) . </P> <H2> Sample text ( edit ) </H2> 1846 sample of printed Czech <P> According to Article 1 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights : </P> <P> Czech : Všichni lidé se rodí svobodní a sobě rovní co do důstojnosti a práv .

{"document_id": 6213, "document_text": "Reason - wikipedia <H1> Reason </H1> Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the human faculty of reason and rationality . For other uses , see Reason ( disambiguation ) . <P> Reason is the capacity for consciously making sense of things , establishing and verifying facts , applying logic , and changing or justifying practices , institutions , and beliefs based on new or existing information . It is closely associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy , science , language , mathematics , and art and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans . Reason , or an aspect of it , is sometimes referred to as rationality . </P> <P> Reasoning is associated with thinking , cognition , and intellect . The philosophical field of logic studies ways in which humans reason formally through argument . Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning ( forms associated with the strict sense ) : deductive reasoning , inductive reasoning , abductive reasoning ; and other modes of reasoning considered more informal , such as intuitive reasoning and verbal reasoning . Along these lines , a distinction is often drawn between logical , discursive reasoning ( reason proper ) , and intuitive reasoning , in which the reasoning process through intuition -- however valid -- may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque . In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash , while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial . For example , in mathematics , intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof , arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks . </P> <P> Reasoning , like habit or intuition , is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea . For example , reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments , or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect , truth and falsehood , or ideas regarding notions of good or bad . Reasoning , as a part of executive decision making , is also closely identified with the ability to self - consciously change , in terms of goals , beliefs , attitudes , traditions , and institutions , and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self - determination . </P> <P> In contrast to the use of `` reason '' as an abstract noun , a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events , phenomena , or behavior . Reasons justify decisions , reasons support explanations of natural phenomena ; reasons can be given to explain the actions ( conduct ) of individuals . </P> <P> Using reason , or reasoning , can also be described more plainly as providing good , or the best , reasons . For example , when evaluating a moral decision , `` morality is , at the very least , the effort to guide one 's conduct by reason -- that is , doing what there are the best reasons for doing -- while giving equal ( and impartial ) weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does . '' </P> <P> Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason , e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged , and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw . The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally . Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Etymology and related words </Li> <Li> 2 Philosophical history <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Classical philosophy </Li> <Li> 2.2 Subject - centred reason in early modern philosophy </Li> <Li> 2.3 Substantive and formal reason </Li> <Li> 2.4 The critique of reason </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Reason compared to related concepts <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Compared to logic </Li> <Li> 3.2 Reason compared to cause - and - effect thinking , and symbolic thinking </Li> <Li> 3.3 Reason , imagination , mimesis , and memory </Li> <Li> 3.4 Logical reasoning methods and argumentation <Ul> <Li> 3.4. 1 Deductive reasoning </Li> <Li> 3.4. 2 Inductive reasoning </Li> <Li> 3.4. 3 Abductive reasoning </Li> <Li> 3.4. 4 Analogical reasoning </Li> <Li> 3.4. 5 Fallacious reasoning </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Traditional problems raised concerning reason <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Reason versus truth , and `` first principles '' </Li> <Li> 4.2 Reason versus emotion or passion </Li> <Li> 4.3 Reason versus faith or tradition </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Reason in particular fields of study <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Reason in political philosophy and ethics </Li> <Li> 5.2 Psychology <Ul> <Li> 5.2. 1 Behavioral experiments on human reasoning </Li> <Li> 5.2. 2 Developmental studies of children 's reasoning </Li> <Li> 5.2. 3 Neuroscience of reasoning </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5.3 Computer science <Ul> <Li> 5.3. 1 Automated reasoning </Li> <Li> 5.3. 2 Meta - reasoning </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5.4 Evolution of reason </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 Further reading </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Etymology and related words ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the English language and other modern European languages , `` reason '' , and related words , represent words which have always been used to translate Latin and classical Greek terms in the sense of their philosophical usage . </P> <Ul> <Li> The original Greek term was `` λόγος '' logos , the root of the modern English word `` logic '' but also a word which could mean for example `` speech '' or `` explanation '' or an `` account '' ( of money handled ) . </Li> <Li> As a philosophical term logos was translated in its non-linguistic senses in Latin as ratio . This was originally not just a translation used for philosophy , but was also commonly a translation for logos in the sense of an account of money . </Li> <Li> French raison is derived directly from Latin , and this is the direct source of the English word `` reason '' . </Li> </Ul> <P> The earliest major philosophers to publish in English , such as Francis Bacon , Thomas Hobbes , and John Locke also routinely wrote in Latin and French , and compared their terms to Greek , treating the words `` logos '' , `` ratio '' , `` raison '' and `` reason '' as inter-changeable . The meaning of the word `` reason '' in senses such as `` human reason '' also overlaps to a large extent with `` rationality '' and the adjective of `` reason '' in philosophical contexts is normally `` rational '' , rather than `` reasoned '' or `` reasonable '' . Some philosophers , Thomas Hobbes for example , also used the word ratiocination as a synonym for `` reasoning '' . </P> <H2> Philosophical history ( edit ) </H2> Francisco de Goya , The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters ( El sueño de la razón produce monstruos ) , c. 1797 <P> The proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western philosophy and later western modern science , starting with classical Greece . Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason , and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times . Reason is often said to be reflexive , or `` self - correcting , '' and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy . It has been defined in different ways , at different times , by different thinkers about human nature . </P> <H3> Classical philosophy ( edit ) </H3> <P> For many classical philosophers , nature was understood teleologically , meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims . Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus , the cosmos is even said to have reason . Reason , by this account , is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have , and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics . Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature , such as sociability , because it is something humans share with nature itself , linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself . Within the human mind or soul ( psyche ) , reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts , such as spiritedness ( thumos ) and the passions . Aristotle , Plato 's student , defined human beings as rational animals , emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature . He defined the highest human happiness or well being ( eudaimonia ) as a life which is lived consistently , excellently and completely in accordance with reason . </P> <P> The conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy . But teleological accounts such as Aristotle 's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul . For example , in the neo-platonist account of Plotinus , the cosmos has one soul , which is the seat of all reason , and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul . Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things , and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source . Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers , and under this influence , mainly via Averroes , came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the renaissance , and they remain important in Iranian philosophy . </P> <H3> Subject - centred reason in early modern philosophy ( edit ) </H3> <P> The early modern era was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason , starting in Europe . One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the metaphysical understanding of human beings . Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world . Nature was no longer assumed to be human - like , with its own aims or reason , and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same `` laws of nature '' which affect inanimate things . This new understanding eventually displaced the previous world view that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe . </P> René Descartes <P> Accordingly , in the 17th century , René Descartes explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as `` rational animals , '' suggesting instead that they are nothing more than `` thinking things '' along the lines of other `` things '' in nature . Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was , therefore , subject to doubt . </P> <P> In his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge , Descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt all knowledge -- except that of the mind itself in the process of thinking : </P> <P> At this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true . I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing ; that is a mind , or intellect , or understanding , or reason -- words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant . </P> <P> This eventually became known as epistemological or `` subject - centred '' reason , because it is based on the knowing subject , who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied , and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study . Breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him , Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts , such as reason and intellect , describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity . </P> <P> A contemporary of Descartes , Thomas Hobbes described reason as a broader version of `` addition and subtraction '' which is not limited to numbers . This understanding of reason is sometimes termed `` calculative '' reason . Similar to Descartes , Hobbes asserted that `` No discourse whatsoever , can end in absolute knowledge of fact , past , or to come '' but that `` sense and memory '' is absolute knowledge . </P> <P> In the late 17th century , through the 18th century , John Locke and David Hume developed Descartes ' line of thought still further . Hume took it in an especially skeptical direction , proposing that there could be no possibility of deducing relationships of cause and effect , and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone , even if it seems otherwise . </P> <P> Hume famously remarked that , `` We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason . Reason is , and ought only to be the slave of the passions , and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them . '' Hume also took his definition of reason to unorthodox extremes by arguing , unlike his predecessors , that human reason is not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual ideas , or from judgments associating two ideas , and that `` reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls , which carries us along a certain train of ideas , and endows them with particular qualities , according to their particular situations and relations . '' It followed from this that animals have reason , only much less complex than human reason . </P> <P> In the 18th century , Immanuel Kant attempted to show that Hume was wrong by demonstrating that a `` transcendental '' self , or `` I '' , was a necessary condition of all experience . Therefore , suggested Kant , on the basis of such a self , it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge . And so long as these limits are respected , reason can be the vehicle of morality , justice , aesthetics , theories of knowledge ( epistemology ) , and understanding . </P> <H3> Substantive and formal reason ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the formulation of Kant , who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject , the great achievement of reason ( German : Vernunft ) is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law - making . Kant was able therefore to re-formulate the basis of moral - practical , theoretical and aesthetic reasoning , on `` universal '' laws . </P> <P> Here practical reasoning is the self - legislating or self - governing formulation of universal norms , and theoretical reasoning the way humans posit universal laws of nature . </P> <P> Under practical reason , the moral autonomy or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason . This contrasted with earlier forms of morality , which depended on religious understanding and interpretation , or nature for their substance . </P> <P> According to Kant , in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit , so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason . He formulated such a principle , called the `` categorical imperative '' , which would justify an action only if it could be universalized : </P> <P> Act only according to that maxim whereby you can , at the same time , will that it should become a universal law . </P> <P> In contrast to Hume then , Kant insists that reason itself ( German Vernunft ) has natural ends itself , the solution to the metaphysical problems , especially the discovery of the foundations of morality . Kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his `` transcendental logic '' which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument , which can be used indifferently , as it was for Aristotle , but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others . </P> <P> According to Jürgen Habermas , the `` substantive unity '' of reason has dissolved in modern times , such that it can no longer answer the question `` How should I live ? '' Instead , the unity of reason has to be strictly formal , or `` procedural . '' He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres ( on the model of Kant 's three critiques ) : </P> <Ol> <Li> Cognitive - instrumental reason is the kind of reason employed by the sciences . It is used to observe events , to predict and control outcomes , and to intervene in the world on the basis of its hypotheses ; </Li> <Li> Moral - practical reason is what we use to deliberate and discuss issues in the moral and political realm , according to universalizable procedures ( similar to Kant 's categorical imperative ) ; and </Li> <Li> Aesthetic reason is typically found in works of art and literature , and encompasses the novel ways of seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices embody . </Li> </Ol> <P> For Habermas , these three spheres are the domain of experts , and therefore need to be mediated with the `` lifeworld '' by philosophers . In drawing such a picture of reason , Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason , which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life , could be made up for by the unity of reason 's formalizable procedures . </P> <H3> The Critique of reason ( edit ) </H3> <P> Hamann , Herder , Kant , Hegel , Kierkegaard , Nietzsche , Heidegger , Foucault , Rorty , and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means , or ought to mean . Some , like Kierkegaard , Nietzsche , and Rorty , are skeptical about subject - centred , universal , or instrumental reason , and even skeptical toward reason as a whole . Others , including Hegel , believe that it has obscured the importance of intersubjectivity , or `` spirit '' in human life , and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be . </P> <P> Some thinkers , e.g. Foucault , believe there are other forms of reason , neglected but essential to modern life , and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason . </P> <P> In the last several decades , a number of proposals have been made to `` re-orient '' this critique of reason , or to recognize the `` other voices '' or `` new departments '' of reason : </P> <P> For example , in opposition to subject - centred reason , Habermas has proposed a model of communicative reason that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity , based on the fact of linguistic intersubjectivity . </P> <P> Nikolas Kompridis has proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as `` that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness '' in human affairs , and a focus on reason 's possibilities for social change . </P> <P> The philosopher Charles Taylor , influenced by the 20th century German philosopher Martin Heidegger , has proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of disclosure , which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life , as a new `` department '' of reason . </P> <P> In the essay `` What is Enlightenment ? '' , Michel Foucault proposed a concept of critique based on Kant 's distinction between `` private '' and `` public '' uses of reason . This distinction , as suggested , has two dimensions : </P> <Ul> <Li> Private reason is the reason that is used when an individual is `` a cog in a machine '' or when one `` has a role to play in society and jobs to do : to be a soldier , to have taxes to pay , to be in charge of a parish , to be a civil servant . '' </Li> <Li> Public reason is the reason used `` when one is reasoning as a reasonable being ( and not as a cog in a machine ) , when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable humanity . '' In these circumstances , `` the use of reason must be free and public . '' </Li> </Ul> <H2> Reason compared to related concepts ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Compared to logic ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Logic <P> The terms `` logic '' or `` logical '' are sometimes used as if they were identical with the term `` reason '' or with the concept of being `` rational '' , or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason . For example in modern economics , rational choice is assumed to equate to logically consistent choice . </P> <P> Reason and logic can however be thought of as distinct , although logic is one important aspect of reason . Author Douglas Hofstadter , in Gödel , Escher , Bach , characterizes the distinction in this way . Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps , working backward , drawing diagrams , looking at examples , or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system . </P> <P> Reason is a type of thought , and the word `` logic '' involves the attempt to describe rules or norms by which reasoning operates , so that orderly reasoning can be taught . The oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the Greek philosopher Aristotle , especially Prior Analysis and Posterior Analysis . Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason , Aristotle 's newly coined word `` syllogism '' ( syllogismos ) identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study . When Aristotle referred to `` the logical '' ( hē logikē ) , he was referring more broadly to rational thought . </P> <H3> Reason compared to cause - and - effect thinking , and symbolic thinking ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Causality and Symbols <P> As pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes , Locke and Hume , some animals are also clearly capable of a type of `` associative thinking '' , even to the extent of associating causes and effects . A dog once kicked , can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future , but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word . It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason . </P> <P> Human reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas , even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect , perceptions of smoke , for example , and memories of fire . For reason to be involved , the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained , for example as cause and effect . In the explanation of Locke , for example , reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism . </P> <P> More generally , reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of symbols , as well as indices and icons , according to Charles Sanders Peirce , the symbols having only a nominal , though habitual , connection to either smoke or fire . One example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is language . </P> <P> The connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers . Thomas Hobbes described the creation of `` Markes , or Notes of remembrance '' ( Leviathan Ch. 4 ) as speech . He used the word speech as an English version of the Greek word logos so that speech did not need to be communicated . When communicated , such speech becomes language , and the marks or notes or remembrance are called `` Signes '' by Hobbes . Going further back , although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason ( logos ) , he does mention that animals with imagination , for whom sense perceptions can persist , come closest to having something like reasoning and nous , and even uses the word `` logos '' in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases . </P> <H3> Reason , imagination , Mimesis , and memory ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Imagination , Mimesis , Memory , and Recollection <P> Reason and imagination rely on similar mental processes . Imagination is not only found in humans . Aristotle , for example , stated that phantasia ( imagination : that which can hold images or phantasmata ) and phronein ( a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense ) also exist in some animals . According to him , both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals , which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals , and without deliberation or logos . But this is not yet reason , because human imagination is different . </P> <P> The recent modern writings of Terrence Deacon and Merlin Donald , writing about the origin of language , also connect reason connected to not only language , but also mimesis , More specifically they describe the ability to create language as part of an internal modeling of reality specific to humankind . Other results are consciousness , and imagination or fantasy . In contrast , modern proponents of a genetic pre-disposition to language itself include Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker , to whom Donald and Deacon can be contrasted . </P> <P> As reason is symbolic thinking , and peculiarly human , then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of `` icons '' or images and the real things they represent . Starting with a modern author , Merlin Donald writes </P> <P> A dog might perceive the `` meaning '' of a fight that was realistically play - acted by humans , but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent ( a real fight ) . ( ... ) Trained apes are able to make this distinction ; young children make this distinction early -- hence , their effortless distinction between play - acting an event and the event itself </P> <P> In classical descriptions , an equivalent description of this mental faculty is eikasia , in the philosophy of Plato . This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else , related somehow but not the same , and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such . What Klein refers to as dianoetic eikasia is the eikasia concerned specifically with thinking and mental images , such as those mental symbols , icons , signes , and marks discussed above as definitive of reason . Explaining reason from this direction : human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible `` objects of thought '' as `` foundations '' ( hypothēses in Ancient Greek ) . This thinking ( dianoia ) is `` ... an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more ' precise ' noēta . '' </P> <P> Both Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of mimesis , often translated as imitation or representation . Donald writes </P> <P> Imitation is found especially in monkeys and apes ( ... but ... ) Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations . ( ... ) Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication . </P> <P> Mimēsis is a concept , now popular again in academic discussion , that was particularly prevalent in Plato 's works , and within Aristotle , it is discussed mainly in the Poetics . In Michael Davis 's account of the theory of man in this work . </P> <P> It is the distinctive feature of human action , that whenever we choose what we do , we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside . Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions , internalizings of the external . All action is therefore imitation of action ; it is poetic ... </P> <P> Donald like Plato ( and Aristotle , especially in On Memory and Recollection ) , emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one 's mental world . The ancient Greek anamnēsis , normally translated as `` recollection '' was opposed to mneme or memory . Memory , shared with some animals , requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past , but also that something happened in the past , which is in other words a kind of eikasia `` ... but nothing except man is able to recollect . '' Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known . Klein writes that , `` To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting . '' Donald calls the same thing autocueing , which he explains as follows : `` Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal , self - generated cues . This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations , without the aid of external cues -- probably the earliest form of representational thinking . '' </P> <P> In a celebrated paper in modern times , the fantasy author and philologist J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in his essay `` On Fairy Stories '' that the terms `` fantasy '' and `` enchantment '' are connected to not only `` ... the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires ... '' but also `` ... the origin of language and of the mind . '' </P> <H3> Logical reasoning methods and argumentation ( edit ) </H3> <P> Looking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning . Formal logic has been described as the science of deduction . The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as informal logic or critical thinking . </P> Deductive reasoning ( edit ) Main article : Deductive reasoning <P> A subdivision of Philosophy is Logic . Logic is the study of reasoning . Deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises . A deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process . One classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in syllogisms like the following : </P> <Ul> <Li> Premise 1 : All humans are mortal . </Li> <Li> Premise 2 : Socrates is a human . </Li> <Li> Conclusion : Socrates is mortal . </Li> </Ul> <P> The reasoning in this argument is valid , because there is no way in which the premises , 1 and 2 , could be true and the conclusion , 3 , be false . </P> Inductive reasoning ( edit ) Main article : Inductive reasoning <P> Induction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types , either specifically or generally , based on previous observation . It is used to ascribe properties or relations to objects or types based on previous observations or experiences , or to formulate general statements or laws based on limited observations of recurring phenomenal patterns . </P> <P> Inductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that , even in the best , or strongest , cases of inductive reasoning , the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion . Instead , the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of probability . Relatedly , the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises . Thus , this method of reasoning is ampliative . </P> <P> A classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the empiricist David Hume : </P> <Ul> <Li> Premise : The sun has risen in the east every morning up until now . </Li> <Li> Conclusion : The sun will also rise in the east tomorrow . </Li> </Ul> Abductive reasoning ( edit ) Main article : Abductive reasoning <P> Abductive reasoning , or argument to the best explanation , is a form of inductive reasoning , since the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved . What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others , by attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion , given a set of more or less disputable assumptions . For example , when a patient displays certain symptoms , there might be various possible causes , but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable . </P> Analogical reasoning ( edit ) Main article : Analogical reasoning <P> Analogical reasoning is reasoning from the particular to the particular . It is often used in case - based reasoning , especially legal reasoning . An example follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> Premise 1 : Socrates is human and mortal . </Li> <Li> Premise 2 : Plato is human . </Li> <Li> Conclusion : Plato is mortal . </Li> </Ul> <P> Analogical reasoning can be viewed as a form of inductive reasoning from a single example , but if it is intended as inductive reasoning it is a bad example , because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general . Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions . For example : </P> <Ul> <Li> Premise 1 : Socrates is human and male . </Li> <Li> Premise 2 : Ada Lovelace is human . </Li> <Li> Conclusion : Therefore Ada Lovelace is male . </Li> </Ul> Fallacious reasoning ( edit ) Main articles : Fallacy , Formal fallacy , and Informal fallacy <P> Flawed reasoning in arguments is known as fallacious reasoning . Bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a formal fallacy or an informal fallacy . </P> <P> Formal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form , or structure , of the argument . The word `` formal '' refers to this link to the form of the argument . An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid . </P> <P> An informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the content , rather than mere structure , of the argument . </P> <H2> Traditional problems raised concerning reason ( edit ) </H2> <P> Philosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason , with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual . Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason , essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim , or philosophizing about philosophizing . The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge . The other question is whether a life of reason , a life that aims to be guided by reason , can be expected to achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life ( whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not ) . </P> <H3> Reason versus truth , and `` first principles '' ( edit ) </H3> See also : Truth , First principle , and Nous <P> Since classical times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate ( which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called Platonism and Aristotelianism ) concerning the role of reason in confirming truth . People use logic , deduction , and induction , to reach conclusions they think are true . Conclusions reached in this way are considered more certain than sense perceptions on their own . On the other hand , if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions , then , our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better . </P> <P> This leads to the question of what types of first principles , or starting points of reasoning , are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions . In Greek , `` first principles '' are archai , `` starting points '' , and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in Aristotle and Plato as nous which was close in meaning to awareness or consciousness . </P> <P> Empiricism ( sometimes associated with Aristotle but more correctly associated with British philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume , as well as their ancient equivalents such as Democritus ) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth . This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that absolute knowledge is not attainable . Idealism , ( associated with Plato and his school ) , claims that there is a `` higher '' reality , from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses , and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth . </P> <P> Philosophers such as Plato , Aristotle , Al - Farabi , Avicenna , Averroes , Maimonides , Aquinas and Hegel are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable -- perhaps by dialectic , analysis , or study . In the vision of these thinkers , reason is divine or at least has divine attributes . Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Étienne Gilson to try to show that reason and revelation are compatible . According to Hegel , `` ... the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History , is the simple conception of reason ; that reason is the Sovereign of the World ; that the history of the world , therefore , presents us with a rational process . '' </P> <P> Since the 17th century rationalists , reason has often been taken to be a subjective faculty , or rather the unaided ability ( pure reason ) to form concepts . For Descartes , Spinoza and Leibniz , this was associated with mathematics . Kant attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts ( time and space ) that are the conditions of experience . Kant made his argument in opposition to Hume , who denied that reason had any role to play in experience . </P> <H3> Reason versus emotion or passion ( edit ) </H3> See also : Emotion and Passion ( emotion ) <P> After Plato and Aristotle , western literature often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites . Stoic philosophy by contrast considered all passions bad . After the critiques of reason in the early Enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or conflated with the passions . Some Enlightenment camps took after the Stoics to say Reason should oppose Passion rather than order it , while others like the Romantics believed that Passion displaces Reason , as in the maxim `` follow your heart '' . </P> <P> Reason has been seen as a slave , or judge , of the passions , notably in the work of David Hume , and more recently of Freud . Reasoning which claims that the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called rationalization . </P> <P> Rousseau first proposed , in his second Discourse , that reason and political life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind . He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind . What , other than reason and civil society , `` best suits his constitution '' ? Rousseau saw `` two principles prior to reason '' in human nature . First we hold an intense interest in our own well - being . Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being , especially one like ourselves . These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve . We become dependent upon each other , and on relationships of authority and obedience . This effectively puts the human race into slavery . Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy . According to Velkley , `` Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self - correction , most notably the political legislation of the Contrat Social and the moral education in Émile . All the same , Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition , that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity . '' </P> <P> This quandary presented by Rousseau led to Kant 's new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil . These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God . In various ways , German Idealism after Kant , and major later figures such Nietzsche , Bergson , Husserl , Scheler , and Heidegger , remain pre-occupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or urges of reason . The influence of Rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics . Many writers ( such as Nikos Kazantzakis ) extol passion and disparage reason . In politics modern nationalism comes from Rousseau 's argument that rationalist cosmopolitanism brings man ever further from his natural state . </P> <P> Another view on reason and emotion was proposed in the 1994 book titled Descartes ' Error by Antonio Damasio . In it , Damasio presents the `` Somatic Marker Hypothesis '' which states that emotions guide behavior and decision - making . Damasio argues that these somatic markers ( known collectively as `` gut feelings '' ) are `` intuitive signals '' that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that can not be solved with rationality alone . Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function . </P> <H3> Reason versus faith or tradition ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Faith , Religion , and Tradition <P> There are many religious traditions , some of which are explicitly fideist and others of which claim varying degrees of rationalism . Secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality , since they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring , suppressing , or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects ( such as religious dogmas , moral taboos , etc . ) . Though the theologies and religions such as classical monotheism typically do not claim to be irrational , there is often a perceived conflict or tension between faith and tradition on the one hand , and reason on the other , as potentially competing sources of wisdom , law and truth . </P> <P> Religious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled , or have different non-overlapping domains , or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism : </P> <Ul> <Li> Reconciliation : Philosopher Alvin Plantinga argues that there is no real conflict between reason and classical theism because classical theism explains ( among other things ) why the universe is intelligible and why reason can successfully grasp it . </Li> <Li> Non-overlapping magisteria : Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould argues that there need not be conflict between reason and religious belief because they are each authoritative in their own domain ( or `` magisterium '' ) . For example , perhaps reason alone is not enough to explain such big questions as the origins of the universe , the origin of life , the origin of consciousness , the foundation of morality , or the destiny of the human race . If so , reason can work on those problems over which it has authority while other sources of knowledge or opinion can have authority on the big questions . </Li> <Li> Tu quoque : Philosophers Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor argue that those critics of traditional religion who are adherents of secular liberalism are also sometimes guilty of ignoring , suppressing , and forbidding some kinds of reasoning about subjects . Similarly , philosophers of science such as Paul Feyaraband argue that scientists sometimes ignore or suppress evidence contrary to the dominant paradigm . </Li> <Li> Unification : Theologian Joseph Ratzinger , later Benedict XVI , asserted that `` Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the Logos , as the religion according to reason , '' referring to John 1 : Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος , usually translated as `` In the beginning was the Word ( Logos ) . '' Thus , he said that the Christian faith is `` open to all that is truly rational , '' and that the rationality of Western Enlightenment `` is of Christian origin '' . </Li> </Ul> <P> Some commentators have claimed that Western civilization can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between `` unaided '' reason and faith in `` revealed '' truths -- figuratively summarized as Athens and Jerusalem , respectively . Leo Strauss spoke of a `` Greater West '' that included all areas under the influence of the tension between Greek rationalism and Abrahamic revelation , including the Muslim lands . He was particularly influenced by the great Muslim philosopher Al - Farabi . To consider to what extent Eastern philosophy might have partaken of these important tensions , Strauss thought it best to consider whether dharma or tao may be equivalent to Nature ( by which we mean physis in Greek ) . According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the `` discovery or invention of nature '' and the `` pre-philosophical equivalent of nature '' was supplied by `` such notions as ' custom ' or ' ways ' '' , which appear to be really universal in all times and places . The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding archai ( first principles of knowledge ) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand , and tradition or faith on the other . </P> <P> Although there is this special history of debate concerning reason and faith in the Islamic , Christian and Jewish traditions , the pursuit of reason is sometimes argued to be compatible with the other practice of other religions of a different nature , such as Hinduism , because they do not define their tenets in such an absolute way . </P> <H2> Reason in particular fields of study ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Reason in political philosophy and Ethics ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Political Philosophy , Ethics , and The Good <P> Aristotle famously described reason ( with language ) as a part of human nature , which means that it is best for humans to live `` politically '' meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small city state ( polis in Greek ) . For example ... </P> <P> It is clear , then , that a human being is more of a political ( politikon = of the polis ) animal ( zōion ) than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds . For nature , as we say , makes nothing in vain , and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech ( logos ) . Voice , of course , serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant ; that is why it is also found in other animals , because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other . But speech ( logos ) serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust . For it is a peculiarity of humans , in contrast to the other animals , to have perception of good and bad , just and unjust , and the like ; and the community in these things makes a household or city ( polis ) . ( ... ) By nature , then , the drive for such a community exists in everyone , but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness . For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected , so they are the worst when divorced from law and right . The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons , and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue , but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses . Consequently , if a human being lacks virtue , he is the most unholy and savage thing , and when it comes to sex and food , the worst . But justice is something political ( to do with the polis ) , for right is the arrangement of the political community , and right is discrimination of what is just . ( Aristotle 's Politics 1253a 1.2 . Peter Simpson 's translation , with Greek terms inserted in square brackets . ) </P> <P> The concept of human nature being fixed in this way , implied , in other words , that we can define what type of community is always best for people . This argument has remained a central argument in all political , ethical and moral thinking since then , and has become especially controversial since firstly Rousseau 's Second Discourse , and secondly , the Theory of Evolution . Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the polis had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves . The household came first , and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that , with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers . </P> <P> Friendship ( philia ) seems to prevail ( in ) man and woman according to nature ( kata phusin ) ; for people are by nature ( tēi phusei ) pairing ( sunduastikon ) more than political ( politikon = of the polis ) , inasmuch as the household ( oikos ) is prior ( proteron = earlier ) and more necessary than the polis and making children is more common ( koinoteron ) with the animals . In the other animals , community ( koinōnia ) goes no further than this , but people live together ( sumoikousin ) not only for the sake of making children , but also for the things for life ; for from the start the functions ( erga ) are divided , and are different ( for ) man and woman . Thus they supply each other , putting their own into the common ( eis to koinon ) . It is for these ( reasons ) that both utility ( chrēsimon ) and pleasure ( hēdu ) seem to be found in this kind of friendship . ( Nicomachean Ethics , VIII. 12.1162 a . Rough literal translation with Greek terms shown in square brackets . ) </P> <P> Rousseau in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse : with reason , language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems , and that once such cooperation became more important , it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation -- often only to defend themselves from each other . </P> <P> In other words , according to Rousseau , reason , language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods , nor because of any pre-existing human nature . As a result , he claimed , living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape . If anything is specifically human in this theory , it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans . This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin 's Theory of Evolution . </P> <P> The two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because , according to the Aristotelian theory , a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances . According to Rousseau , we should even doubt that reason , language and politics are a good thing , as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today . Rousseau 's theory , that human nature is malleable rather than fixed , is often taken to imply , for example by Karl Marx , a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known . </P> <P> However , while Rousseau 's initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics , including both the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution , his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical , in favor of city - states such as Geneva , and rural living . </P> <H3> Psychology ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Psychology of reasoning <P> Scientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of psychology and cognitive science . Psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances . </P> <P> Assessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is rational or acts rationally . It is a key research question in the psychology of reasoning . Rationality is often divided into its respective theoretical and practical counterparts . </P> Behavioral Experiments on human reasoning ( edit ) <P> Experimental cognitive psychologists carry out research on reasoning behaviour . Such research may focus , for example , on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or IQ tests , or on how well people 's reasoning matches ideals set by logic ( see , for example , the Wason test ) . Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g. , If A then B and how they make inferences about alternatives , e.g. , A or else B. They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations , e.g. , A is to the left of B , or A happens after B , and about quantified assertions , e.g. , All the A are B. Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations , hypothetical possibilities , probabilities , and counterfactual situations . </P> Developmental Studies of children 's reasoning ( edit ) <P> Developmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood . Piaget 's theory of cognitive development was the first complete theory of reasoning development . Subsequently , several alternative theories were proposed , including the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development . </P> Neuroscience of reasoning ( edit ) <P> The biological functioning of the brain is studied by neurophysiologists and neuropsychologists . Research in this area includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains , and of damaged or otherwise unusual brains . In addition to carrying out research into reasoning , some psychologists , for example , clinical psychologists and psychotherapists work to alter people 's reasoning habits when they are unhelpful . </P> <H3> Computer science ( edit ) </H3> Automated reasoning ( edit ) Main articles : Automated reasoning and Computational logic <P> In artificial intelligence and computer science , scientists study and use automated reasoning for diverse applications including automated theorem proving the formal semantics of programming languages , and formal specification in software engineering . </P> Meta - reasoning ( edit ) Main article : Metacognition <P> Meta - reasoning is reasoning about reasoning . In computer science , a system performs meta - reasoning when it is reasoning about its own operation . This requires a programming language capable of reflection , the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour . </P> <H3> Evolution of reason ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( August 2017 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> Dan Sperber believes that reasoning in groups is more effective and promotes their evolutionary fitness . <P> A species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about , predict and understand the world . French social and cognitive scientists Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier argue that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason . They point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively , and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs ( confirmation bias ) . Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective - as demonstrated by the success of projects like science . They suggest that there are not just individual , but group selection pressures at play . Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members , increasing their fitness . This could also help explain why humans , according to Sperber , are not optimized to reason effectively alone . Their argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than with the search for the truth . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Thinking portal </Li> <Li> Logic portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Confirmation bias </Li> <Li> Conformity </Li> <Li> Logic and rationality </Li> <Li> Outline of thought - topic tree that identifies many types of thoughts / thinking , types of reasoning , aspects of thought , related fields , and more . </Li> <Li> Outline of human intelligence - topic tree presenting the traits , capacities , models , and research fields of human intelligence , and more . </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Kompridis , Nikolas ( 2000 ) . `` So We Need Something Else for Reason to Mean '' .

You then realize that the presence of a creative deity in the universe is clearly a scientific hypothesis . Indeed , it is hard to imagine a more momentous hypothesis in all of science . A universe with a god would be a completely different kind of universe from one without , and it would be a scientific difference . God could clinch the matter in his favour at any moment by staging a spectacular demonstration of his powers , one that would satisfy the exacting standards of science . Even the infamous Templeton Foundation recognized that God is a scientific hypothesis -- by funding double - blind trials to test whether remote prayer would speed the recovery of heart patients .
